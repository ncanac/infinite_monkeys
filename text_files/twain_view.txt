explanatory

in this book a number of dialects are used to wit the missouri negro
dialect the extremest form of the backwoods southwestern dialect the
ordinary pike county dialect and four modified varieties of this last 
the shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion or by guesswork 
but painstakingly and with the trustworthy guidance and support of
personal familiarity with these several forms of speech 

i make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would
suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not
succeeding

adventures of huckleberry finn

scene the mississippi valley time forty to fifty years ago



chapter i 

you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of the
adventures of tom sawyer but that aint no matter that book was made
by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly there was things which
he stretched but mainly he told the truth that is nothing i never
seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or
the widow or maybe mary aunt polly toms aunt polly she is and
mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is
mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said before 

now the way that the book winds up is this tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich we got six
thousand dollars apiece all gold it was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at
interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round
 more than a body could tell what to do with the widow douglas she took
me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough
living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and
decent the widow was in all her ways and so when i couldnt stand it no
longer i lit out i got into my old rags and my sugar hogshead again 
and was free and satisfied but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he
was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back
to the widow and be respectable so i went back 

the widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she
called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it 
she put me in them new clothes again and i couldnt do nothing but sweat
and sweat and feel all cramped up well then the old thing commenced
again the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time 
when you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating but you had to
wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the
victuals though there warnt really anything the matter with them that
is nothing only everything was cooked by itself in a barrel of odds
and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of
swaps around and the things go better 

after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the
bulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by
she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time so then
i didnt care no more about him because i dont take no stock in dead
people 

pretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me but she
wouldnt she said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and i must
try to not do it any more that is just the way with some people they
get down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it here she was
a bothering about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody 
being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
thing that had some good in it and she took snuff too of course that
was all right because she done it herself 

her sister miss watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on 
had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a
spelling book she worked me middling hard for about an hour and then
the widow made her ease up i couldnt stood it much longer then for
an hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety miss watson would say 
 dont put your feet up there huckleberry and dont scrunch up like
that huckleberry set up straight and pretty soon she would say 
 dont gap and stretch like that huckleberry why dont you try to
behave then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wished i
was there she got mad then but i didnt mean no harm all i wanted was
to go somewheres all i wanted was a change i warnt particular she
said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldnt say it for the
whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place well 
i couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so i made up my
mind i wouldnt try for it but i never said so because it would only
make trouble and wouldnt do no good 

now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good
place she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
day long with a harp and sing forever and ever so i didnt think much
of it but i never said so i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would
go there and she said not by a considerable sight i was glad about
that because i wanted him and me to be together 

miss watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome by
and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and then everybody
was off to bed i went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it
on the table then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to
think of something cheerful but it warnt no use i felt so lonesome i
most wished i was dead the stars were shining and the leaves rustled
in the woods ever so mournful and i heard an owl away off who whooing
about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about
somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper
something to me and i couldnt make out what it was and so it made the
cold shivers run over me then away out in the woods i heard that kind of
a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something thats
on its mind and cant make itself understood and so cant rest easy in
its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving i got so
down hearted and scared i did wish i had some company pretty soon a
spider went crawling up my shoulder and i flipped it off and it lit in
the candle and before i could budge it was all shriveled up i didnt
need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch
me some bad luck so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me 
i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast
every time and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to
keep witches away but i hadnt no confidence you do that when youve
lost a horseshoe that youve found instead of nailing it up over the
door but i hadnt ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad
luck when youd killed a spider 

i set down again a shaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke 
for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldnt
know well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go
boom boom boom twelve licks and all still again stiller than ever 
pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees
 something was a stirring i set still and listened directly i could
just barely hear a me yow me yow down there that was good says i 
 me yow me yow as soft as i could and then i put out the light and
scrambled out of the window on to the shed then i slipped down to the
ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enough there was tom
sawyer waiting for me 




chapter ii 

we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
the widows garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape our
heads when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a
noise we scrouched down and laid still miss watsons big nigger 
named jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty
clear because there was a light behind him he got up and stretched his
neck out about a minute listening then he says 

 who dah 

he listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
between us we could a touched him nearly well likely it was minutes
and minutes that there warnt a sound and we all there so close
together there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but i
dasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right
between my shoulders seemed like id die if i couldnt scratch well 
ive noticed that thing plenty times since if you are with the quality 
or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aint sleepy if you
are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch why you will itch all
over in upwards of a thousand places pretty soon jim says 

 say who is you whar is you dog my cats ef i didn hear sumfn 
well i know what is gwyne to do is gwyne to set down here and listen
tell i hears it agin 

so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom he leaned his back up
against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
one of mine my nose begun to itch it itched till the tears come into
my eyes but i dasnt scratch then it begun to itch on the inside 
next i got to itching underneath i didnt know how i was going to set
still this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it
seemed a sight longer than that i was itching in eleven different
places now i reckoned i couldnt stand it moren a minute longer but i
set my teeth hard and got ready to try just then jim begun to breathe
heavy next he begun to snore and then i was pretty soon comfortable
again 

tom he made a sign to me kind of a little noise with his mouth and we
went creeping away on our hands and knees when we was ten foot off tom
whispered to me and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun but i said
no he might wake and make a disturbance and then theyd find out i
warnt in then tom said he hadnt got candles enough and he would slip
in the kitchen and get some more i didnt want him to try i said jim
might wake up and come but tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there
and got three candles and tom laid five cents on the table for pay 
then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do
tom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hands and knees and play
something on him i waited and it seemed a good while everything was
so still and lonesome 

as soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence 
and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house tom said he slipped jims hat off of his head and hung it on
a limb right over him and jim stirred a little but he didnt wake 
afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance 
and rode him all over the state and then set him under the trees again 
and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it and next time jim told
it he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that every time
he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode
him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all
over saddle boils jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he
wouldnt hardly notice the other niggers niggers would come miles to
hear jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in
that country strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and
look him all over same as if he was a wonder niggers is always talking
about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was
talking and letting on to know all about such things jim would happen in
and say hm what you know bout witches and that nigger was corked
up and had to take a back seat jim always kept that five center piece
round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to
him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and
fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but
he never told what it was he said to it niggers would come from all
around there and give jim anything they had just for a sight of that
five center piece but they wouldnt touch it because the devil had had
his hands on it jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck
up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches 

well when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where
there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so
fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and
awful still and grand we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben
rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard so we
unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the
big scar on the hillside and went ashore 

we went to a clump of bushes and tom made everybody swear to keep the
secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest
part of the bushes then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands
and knees we went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up 
tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall
where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole we went along a
narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold 
and there we stopped tom says 

 now well start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyers gang 
everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name
in blood 

everybody was willing so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote
the oath on and read it it swore every boy to stick to the band and
never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in
the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family
must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till he had killed
them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band 
and nobody that didnt belong to the band could use that mark and if he
did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed and if
anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his
throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered
all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never
mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot
forever 

everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked tom if he got it
out of his own head he said some of it but the rest was out of
pirate books and robber books and every gang that was high toned had it 

some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the
secrets tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it
in then ben rogers says 

 heres huck finn he haint got no family what you going to do bout
him 

 well haint he got a father says tom sawyer 

 yes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days he
used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seen
in these parts for a year or more 

they talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said
every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldnt be
fair and square for the others well nobody could think of anything to
do everybody was stumped and set still i was most ready to cry but
all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them miss watson they
could kill her everybody said 

 oh shell do thats all right huck can come in 

then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and
i made my mark on the paper 

 now says ben rogers whats the line of business of this gang 

 nothing only robbery and murder tom said 

 but who are we going to rob houses or cattle or 

 stuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglary 
says tom sawyer we aint burglars that aint no sort of style we
are highwaymen we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on 
and kill the people and take their watches and money 

 must we always kill the people 

 oh certainly its best some authorities think different but mostly
its considered best to kill them except some that you bring to the cave
here and keep them till theyre ransomed 

 ransomed whats that 

 i dont know but thats what they do ive seen it in books and so
of course thats what weve got to do 

 but how can we do it if we dont know what it is 

 why blame it all weve got to do it dont i tell you its in the
books do you want to go to doing different from whats in the books 
and get things all muddled up 

 oh thats all very fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nation are
these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do it to them 
 thats the thing i want to get at now what do you reckon it is 

 well i dont know but peraps if we keep them till theyre ransomed 
it means that we keep them till theyre dead 

 now thats something like thatll answer why couldnt you said that
before well keep them till theyre ransomed to death and a bothersome
lot theyll be too eating up everything and always trying to get
loose 

 how you talk ben rogers how can they get loose when theres a guard
over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg 

 a guard well that is good so somebodys got to set up all night and
never get any sleep just so as to watch them i think thats
foolishness why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they
get here 

 because it aint in the books so thats why now ben rogers do you
want to do things regular or dont you thats the idea dont you
reckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correct thing
to do do you reckon you can learn em anything not by a good deal 
no sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular way 

 all right i dont mind but i say its a fool way anyhow say do we
kill the women too 

 well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldnt let on kill
the women no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that you
fetch them to the cave and youre always as polite as pie to them and
by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any
more 

 well if thats the way im agreed but i dont take no stock in it 
mighty soon well have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows
waiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbers 
but go ahead i aint got nothing to say 

little tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was
scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didnt
want to be a robber any more 

so they all made fun of him and called him cry baby and that made him
mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets but tom
give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet
next week and rob somebody and kill some people 

ben rogers said he couldnt get out much only sundays and so he wanted
to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
on sunday and that settled the thing they agreed to get together and
fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first
captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home 

i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
breaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was
dog tired 




chapter iii 

well i got a good going over in the morning from old miss watson on
account of my clothes but the widow she didnt scold but only cleaned
off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i would
behave awhile if i could then miss watson she took me in the closet and
prayed but nothing come of it she told me to pray every day and
whatever i asked for i would get it but it warnt so i tried it 
once i got a fish line but no hooks it warnt any good to me without
hooks i tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow i couldnt
make it work by and by one day i asked miss watson to try for me but
she said i was a fool she never told me why and i couldnt make it out
no way 

i set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it i
says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dont
deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork why cant the widow get
back her silver snuffbox that was stole why cant miss watson fat up 
no says i to my self there aint nothing in it i went and told the
widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it
was spiritual gifts this was too many for me but she told me what
she meant i must help other people and do everything i could for other
people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself 
this was including miss watson as i took it i went out in the woods
and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldnt see no
advantage about it except for the other people so at last i reckoned i
wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go sometimes the
widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a
bodys mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and
knock it all down again i judged i could see that there was two
providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
widows providence but if miss watsons got him there warnt no help for
him any more i thought it all out and reckoned i would belong to the
widows if he wanted me though i couldnt make out how he was a going to
be any better off then than what he was before seeing i was so ignorant 
and so kind of low down and ornery 

pap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable
for me i didnt want to see him no more he used to always whale me
when he was sober and could get his hands on me though i used to take to
the woods most of the time when he was around well about this time he
was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people
said they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just
his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like
pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it had been
in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all they said he was
floating on his back in the water they took him and buried him on the
bank but i warnt comfortable long because i happened to think of
something i knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float on his
back but on his face so i knowed then that this warnt pap but a
woman dressed up in a mans clothes so i was uncomfortable again i
judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished he
wouldnt 

we played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned all
the boys did we hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people but
only just pretended we used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hog drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but
we never hived any of them tom sawyer called the hogs ingots and he
called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and
powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and
marked but i couldnt see no profit in it one time tom sent a boy to
run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was
the sign for the gang to get together and then he said he had got
secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish
merchants and rich a rabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two
hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter 
mules all loaded down with dimonds and they didnt have only a guard
of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called
it and kill the lot and scoop the things he said we must slick up our
swords and guns and get ready he never could go after even a
turnip cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it 
though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them
till you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes more than
what they was before i didnt believe we could lick such a crowd of
spaniards and a rabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephants so i
was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the
word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill but there warnt no
spaniards and a rabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants it
warnt anything but a sunday school picnic and only a primer class at
that we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we
never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers got a
rag doll and jo harper got a hymn book and a tract and then the teacher
charged in and made us drop everything and cut i didnt see no
dimonds and i told tom sawyer so he said there was loads of them
there anyway and he said there was a rabs there too and elephants and
things i said why couldnt we see them then he said if i warnt so
ignorant but had read a book called don quixote i would know without
asking he said it was all done by enchantment he said there was
hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we
had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole
thing into an infant sunday school just out of spite i said all
right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians tom
sawyer said i was a numskull 

 why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would
hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson they are as
tall as a tree and as big around as a church 

 well i says spose we got some genies to help us cant we lick the
other crowd then 

 how you going to get them 

 i dont know how do they get them 

 why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come
tearing in with the thunder and lightning a ripping around and the smoke
a rolling and everything theyre told to do they up and do it they
dont think nothing of pulling a shot tower up by the roots and belting
a sunday school superintendent over the head with it or any other man 

 who makes them tear around so 

 why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring they belong to whoever rubs the
lamp or the ring and theyve got to do whatever he says if he tells
them to build a palace forty miles long out of dimonds and fill it full
of chewing gum or whatever you want and fetch an emperors daughter
from china for you to marry theyve got to do it and theyve got to do
it before sun up next morning too and more theyve got to waltz that
palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand 

 well says i i think they are a pack of flat heads for not keeping
the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that and whats
more if i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would
drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp 

 how you talk huck finn why youd have to come when he rubbed it 
whether you wanted to or not 

 what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church all right then 
i would come but i lay id make that man climb the highest tree there
was in the country 

 shucks it aint no use to talk to you huck finn you dont seem to
know anything somehow perfect saphead 

i thought all this over for two or three days and then i reckoned i
would see if there was anything in it i got an old tin lamp and an iron
ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like
an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warnt no
use none of the genies come so then i judged that all that stuff was
only just one of tom sawyers lies i reckoned he believed in the a rabs
and the elephants but as for me i think different it had all the marks
of a sunday school 




chapter iv 

well three or four months run along and it was well into the winter
now i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and
write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six
times seven is thirty five and i dont reckon i could ever get any
further than that if i was to live forever i dont take no stock in
mathematics anyway 

at first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand it 
whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got next
day done me good and cheered me up so the longer i went to school the
easier it got to be i was getting sort of used to the widows ways 
too and they warnt so raspy on me living in a house and sleeping in a
bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather i used
to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to
me i liked the old ways best but i was getting so i liked the new
ones too a little bit the widow said i was coming along slow but sure 
and doing very satisfactory she said she warnt ashamed of me 

one morning i happened to turn over the salt cellar at breakfast i
reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder
and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of me and
crossed me off she says take your hands away huckleberry what a mess
you are always making the widow put in a good word for me but that
warnt going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough i
started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering
where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be there is
ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasnt one of them
kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked along low spirited
and on the watch out 

i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
through the high board fence there was an inch of new snow on the
ground and i seen somebodys tracks they had come up from the quarry
and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden
fence it was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so i
couldnt make it out it was very curious somehow i was going to
follow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first i didnt
notice anything at first but next i did there was a cross in the left
boot heel made with big nails to keep off the devil 

i was up in a second and shinning down the hill i looked over my
shoulder every now and then but i didnt see nobody i was at judge
thatchers as quick as i could get there he said 

 why my boy you are all out of breath did you come for your
interest 

 no sir i says is there some for me 

 oh yes a half yearly is in last night over a hundred and fifty
dollars quite a fortune for you you had better let me invest it along
with your six thousand because if you take it youll spend it 

 no sir i says i dont want to spend it i dont want it at all
 nor the six thousand nuther i want you to take it i want to give it
to you the six thousand and all 

he looked surprised he couldnt seem to make it out he says 

 why what can you mean my boy 

i says dont you ask me no questions about it please youll take it
 wont you 

he says 

 well im puzzled is something the matter 

 please take it says i and dont ask me nothing then i wont have to
tell no lies 

he studied a while and then he says 

 oho o i think i see you want to sell all your property to me not
give it thats the correct idea 

then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says 

 there you see it says for a consideration that means i have bought
it of you and paid you for it heres a dollar for you now you sign
it 

so i signed it and left 

miss watsons nigger jim had a hair ball as big as your fist which had
been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic
with it he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed
everything so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again 
for i found his tracks in the snow what i wanted to know was what he
was going to do and was he going to stay jim got out his hair ball and
said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the
floor it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch jim tried
it again and then another time and it acted just the same jim got
down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened but it
warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk he said sometimes it wouldnt
talk without money i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter
that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silver a little 
and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt show because it was
so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time i
reckoned i wouldnt say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge i
said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hair ball would take it 
because maybe it wouldnt know the difference jim smelt it and bit it
and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hair ball would think it
was good he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the
quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you
couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no more and so
anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hair ball well 
i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot it 

jim put the quarter under the hair ball and got down and listened again 
this time he said the hair ball was all right he said it would tell my
whole fortune if i wanted it to i says go on so the hair ball talked
to jim and jim told it to me he says

when i lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his
own self 




chapter v 

i had shut the door to then i turned around and there he was i used
to be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much i reckoned i was
scared now too but in a minute i see i was mistaken that is after the
first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so
unexpected but right away after i see i warnt scared of him worth
bothring about 

he was most fifty and he looked it his hair was long and tangled and
greasy and hung down and you could see his eyes shining through like he
was behind vines it was all black no gray so was his long mixed up
whiskers there warnt no color in his face where his face showed it
was white not like another mans white but a white to make a body sick 
a white to make a bodys flesh crawl a tree toad white a fish belly
white as for his clothes just rags that was all he had one ankle
resting on tother knee the boot on that foot was busted and two of his
toes stuck through and he worked them now and then his hat was laying
on the floor an old black slouch with the top caved in like a lid 

i stood a looking at him he set there a looking at me with his chair
tilted back a little i set the candle down i noticed the window was
up so he had clumb in by the shed he kept a looking me all over by
and by he says

couldnt read and she couldnt write nuther before she died none of
the family couldnt before they died i cant and here youre
a swelling yourself up like this i aint the man to stand it you hear 
say lemme hear you read 

i took up a book and begun something about general washington and the
wars when id read about a half a minute he fetched the book a whack
with his hand and knocked it across the house he says 

 its so you can do it i had my doubts when you told me now looky
here you stop that putting on frills i wont have it ill lay for
you my smarty and if i catch you about that school ill tan you good 
first you know youll get religion too i never see such a son 

he took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy and
says

 its something they give me for learning my lessons good 

he tore it up and says 

 ill give you something better ill give you a cowhide 

he set there a mumbling and a growling a minute and then he says 

 aint you a sweet scented dandy though a bed and bedclothes and a
lookn glass and a piece of carpet on the floor and your own father
got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard i never see such a son i
bet ill take some o these frills out o you before im done with you 
why there aint no end to your airs they say youre rich hey hows

 they lie thats how 

 looky here mind how you talk to me im a standing about all i can
stand now so dont gimme no sass ive been in town two days and i
haint heard nothing but about you bein rich i heard about it away
down the river too thats why i come you git me that money
to morrow i want it 

 i haint got no money 

 its a lie judge thatchers got it you git it i want it 

 i haint got no money i tell you you ask judge thatcher hell tell

 all right ill ask him and ill make him pungle too or ill know
the reason why say how much you got in your pocket i want it 

 i haint got only a dollar and i want that to 

 it dont make no difference what you want it for you just shell it
out 

he took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he was
going down town to get some whisky said he hadnt had a drink all day 
when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me
for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when i
reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told me
to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me
if i didnt drop that 

next day he was drunk and he went to judge thatchers and bullyragged
him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldnt and then
he swore hed make the law force him 

the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from
him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had
just come and he didnt know the old man so he said courts mustnt
interfere and separate families if they could help it said hed druther
not take a child away from its father so judge thatcher and the widow
had to quit on the business 

that pleased the old man till he couldnt rest he said hed cowhide me
till i was black and blue if i didnt raise some money for him i
borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher and pap took it and got
drunk and went a blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight 
then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed
him again for a week but he said he was satisfied said he was boss of
his son and hed make it warm for him 

when he got out the new judge said he was a going to make a man of him 
so he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and
had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just
old pie to him so to speak and after supper he talked to him about
temperance and such things till the old man cried and said hed been a
fool and fooled away his life but now he was a going to turn over a new
leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped the judge
would help him and not look down on him the judge said he could hug him
for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said hed
been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said
he believed it the old man said that what a man wanted that was down
was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again and
when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says 

 look at it gentlemen and ladies all take a hold of it shake it 
theres a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more its
the hand of a man thats started in on a new life andll die before
hell go back you mark them words dont forget i said them its a
clean hand now shake it dont be afeard 

so they shook it one after the other all around and cried the
judges wife she kissed it then the old man he signed a pledge made
his mark the judge said it was the holiest time on record or something
like that then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was
the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
clumb out on to the porch roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
new coat for a jug of forty rod and clumb back again and had a good old
time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and
rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most
froze to death when somebody found him after sun up and when they come
to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
navigate it 

the judge he felt kind of sore he said he reckoned a body could reform
the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other way 




chapter vi 

well pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went
for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he
went for me too for not stopping school he catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me but i went to school just the same and dodged him
or outrun him most of the time i didnt want to go to school much
before but i reckoned id go now to spite pap that law trial was a
slow business appeared like they warnt ever going to get started on
it so every now and then id borrow two or three dollars off of the
judge for him to keep from getting a cowhiding every time he got money
he got drunk and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town and
every time he raised cain he got jailed he was just suited this kind
of thing was right in his line 

he got to hanging around the widows too much and so she told him at last
that if he didnt quit using around there she would make trouble for him 
well wasnt he mad he said he would show who was huck finns boss so
he watched out for me one day in the spring and catched me and took me
up the river about three mile in a skiff and crossed over to the
illinois shore where it was woody and there warnt no houses but an old
log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldnt find it if
you didnt know where it was 

he kept me with him all the time and i never got a chance to run off 
we lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put the key
under his head nights he had a gun which he had stole i reckon and we
fished and hunted and that was what we lived on every little while he
locked me in and went down to the store three miles to the ferry and
traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and
had a good time and licked me the widow she found out where i was by
and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove
him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till i was used to
being where i was and liked it all but the cowhide part 

it was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking
and fishing and no books nor study two months or more run along and
my clothes got to be all rags and dirt and i didnt see how id ever got
to like it so well at the widows where you had to wash and eat on a
plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forever
bothering over a book and have old miss watson pecking at you all the
time i didnt want to go back no more i had stopped cussing because
the widow didnt like it but now i took to it again because pap hadnt
no objections it was pretty good times up in the woods there take it
all around 

but by and by pap got too handy with his hickry and i couldnt stand
it i was all over welts he got to going away so much too and locking
me in once he locked me in and was gone three days it was dreadful
lonesome i judged he had got drownded and i wasnt ever going to get
out any more i was scared i made up my mind i would fix up some way
to leave there i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time but i
couldnt find no way there warnt a window to it big enough for a dog
to get through i couldnt get up the chimbly it was too narrow the
door was thick solid oak slabs pap was pretty careful not to leave a
knife or anything in the cabin when he was away i reckon i had hunted
the place over as much as a hundred times well i was most all the time
at it because it was about the only way to put in the time but this
time i found something at last i found an old rusty wood saw without any
handle it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof 
i greased it up and went to work there was an old horse blanket nailed
against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table to keep
the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out i
got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a
section of the big bottom log out big enough to let me through well 
it was a good long job but i was getting towards the end of it when i
heard paps gun in the woods i got rid of the signs of my work and
dropped the blanket and hid my saw and pretty soon pap come in 

pap warnt in a good humor so he was his natural self he said he was
down town and everything was going wrong his lawyer said he reckoned
he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
the trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and judge
thatcher knowed how to do it and he said people allowed thered be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
guardian and they guessed it would win this time this shook me up
considerable because i didnt want to go back to the widows any more
and be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it then the old man
got to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think of 
and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped any 
and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round 
including a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the names
of and so called them whats his name when he got to them and went
right along with his cussing 

he said he would like to see the widow get me he said he would watch
out and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place
six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they
dropped and they couldnt find me that made me pretty uneasy again but
only for a minute i reckoned i wouldnt stay on hand till he got that
chance 

the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got 
there was a fifty pound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon 
ammunition and a four gallon jug of whisky and an old book and two
newspapers for wadding besides some tow i toted up a load and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest i thought it all
over and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines and
take to the woods when i run away i guessed i wouldnt stay in one
place but just tramp right across the country mostly night times and
hunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man nor
the widow couldnt ever find me any more i judged i would saw out and
leave that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckoned he would i got
so full of it i didnt notice how long i was staying till the old man
hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded 

i got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark while
i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
warmed up and went to ripping again he had been drunk over in town 
and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at a body
would a thought he was adam he was just all mud whenever his liquor
begun to work he most always went for the govment this time he says 

 call this a govment why just look at it and see what its like 
heres the law a standing ready to take a mans son away from him a
mans own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and
all the expense of raising yes just as that man has got that son
raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin for him
and give him a rest the law up and goes for him and they call that
govment that aint all nuther the law backs that old judge thatcher
up and helps him to keep me out o my property heres what the law
does the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and upards and
jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and lets him go round in
clothes that aint fitten for a hog they call that govment a man cant
get his rights in a govment like this sometimes ive a mighty notion to
just leave the country for good and all yes and i told em so i told
old thatcher so to his face lots of em heard me and can tell what i
said says i for two cents id leave the blamed country and never come
a near it agin thems the very words i says look at my hat if you
call it a hat but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till
its below my chin and then it aint rightly a hat at all but more like
my head was shoved up through a jint o stove pipe look at it says i
 such a hat for me to wear one of the wealthiest men in this town if i
could git my rights 

 oh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful why looky here 
there was a free nigger there from ohio a mulatter most as white as a
white man he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the
shiniest hat and there aint a man in that town thats got as fine
clothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a
silver headed cane the awfulest old gray headed nabob in the state and
what do you think they said he was a pfessor in a college and could
talk all kinds of languages and knowed everything and that aint the
wust they said he could vote when he was at home well that let me
out thinks i what is the country a coming to it was lection day and
i was just about to go and vote myself if i warnt too drunk to get
there but when they told me there was a state in this country where
theyd let that nigger vote i drawed out i says ill never vote agin 
thems the very words i said they all heard me and the country may rot
for all me ill never vote agin as long as i live and to see the cool
way of that nigger why he wouldnt a give me the road if i hadnt
shoved him out o the way i says to the people why aint this nigger
put up at auction and sold thats what i want to know and what do you
reckon they said why they said he couldnt be sold till hed been in
the state six months and he hadnt been there that long yet there 
now thats a specimen they call that a govment that cant sell a free
nigger till hes been in the state six months heres a govment that
calls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is a
govment and yets got to set stock still for six whole months before it
can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal white shirted free
nigger and 

pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
taking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
barked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of
language mostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the
tub some too all along here and there he hopped around the cabin
considerable first on one leg and then on the other holding first one
shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot
all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick but it warnt good
judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking
out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl that fairly made a
bodys hair raise and down he went in the dirt and rolled there and
held his toes and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had
ever done previous he said so his own self afterwards he had heard
old sowberry hagan in his best days and he said it laid over him too 
but i reckon that was sort of piling it on maybe 

after supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky there for
two drunks and one delirium tremens that was always his word i judged
he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would steal the key 
or saw myself out one or tother he drank and drank and tumbled down
on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way he didnt go
sound asleep but was uneasy he groaned and moaned and thrashed around
this way and that for a long time at last i got so sleepy i couldnt
keep my eyes open all i could do and so before i knowed what i was about
i was sound asleep and the candle burning 

i dont know how long i was asleep but all of a sudden there was an
awful scream and i was up there was pap looking wild and skipping
around every which way and yelling about snakes he said they was
crawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and say
one had bit him on the cheek but i couldnt see no snakes he started
and run round and round the cabin hollering take him off take him off 
hes biting me on the neck i never see a man look so wild in the eyes 
pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then he rolled
over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which way and
striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming and saying
there was devils a hold of him he wore out by and by and laid still a
while moaning then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound i could
hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and it seemed
terrible still he was laying over by the corner by and by he raised up
part way and listened with his head to one side he says very low 

 tramp tramp tramp thats the dead tramp tramp tramp theyre
coming after me but i wont go oh theyre here dont touch me
 dont hands off theyre cold let go oh let a poor devil alone 

then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him
alone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
old pine table still a begging and then he went to crying i could
hear him through the blanket 

by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and he
see me and went for me he chased me round and round the place with a
clasp knife calling me the angel of death and saying he would kill me 
and then i couldnt come for him no more i begged and told him i was
only huck but he laughed such a screechy laugh and roared and cussed 
and kept on chasing me up once when i turned short and dodged under his
arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders and i
thought i was gone but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning and
saved myself pretty soon he was all tired out and dropped down with his
back against the door and said he would rest a minute and then kill me 
he put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and
then he would see who was who 

so he dozed off pretty soon by and by i got the old split bottom chair
and clumb up as easy as i could not to make any noise and got down the
gun i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then i
laid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set down
behind it to wait for him to stir and how slow and still the time did
drag along 




chapter vii 

 git up what you bout 

i opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where i was it
was after sun up and i had been sound asleep pap was standing over me
looking sour and sick too he says 

 what you doin with this gun 

i judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so i says 

 somebody tried to get in so i was laying for him 

 why didnt you roust me out 

 well i tried to but i couldnt i couldnt budge you 

 well all right dont stand there palavering all day but out with you
and see if theres a fish on the lines for breakfast ill be along in a
minute 

he unlocked the door and i cleared out up the river bank i noticed
some pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling of
bark so i knowed the river had begun to rise i reckoned i would have
great times now if i was over at the town the june rise used to be
always luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comes
cordwood floating down and pieces of log rafts sometimes a dozen logs
together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
wood yards and the sawmill 

i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tother one out for
what the rise might fetch along well all at once here comes a canoe 
just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high
like a duck i shot head first off of the bank like a frog clothes and
all on and struck out for the canoe i just expected thered be
somebody laying down in it because people often done that to fool folks 
and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theyd raise up and
laugh at him but it warnt so this time it was a drift canoe sure
enough and i clumb in and paddled her ashore thinks i the old man
will be glad when he sees this shes worth ten dollars but when i
got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as i was running her into a
little creek like a gully all hung over with vines and willows i struck
another idea i judged id hide her good and then stead of taking to
the woods when i run off id go down the river about fifty mile and camp
in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramping on foot 

it was pretty close to the shanty and i thought i heard the old man
coming all the time but i got her hid and then i out and looked around
a bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece just
drawing a bead on a bird with his gun so he hadnt seen anything 

when he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line he abused me
a little for being so slow but i told him i fell in the river and that
was what made me so long i knowed he would see i was wet and then he
would be asking questions we got five catfish off the lines and went
home 

while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being about
wore out i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap
and the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thing
than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me you
see all kinds of things might happen well i didnt see no way for a
while but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
water and he says 

 another time a man comes a prowling round here you roust me out you
hear that man warnt here for no good id a shot him next time you
roust me out you hear 

then he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had been saying
give me the very idea i wanted i says to myself i can fix it now so
nobody wont think of following me 

about twelve oclock we turned out and went along up the bank the river
was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on the rise 
by and by along comes part of a log raft nine logs fast together we
went out with the skiff and towed it ashore then we had dinner 
anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catch
more stuff but that warnt paps style nine logs was enough for one
time he must shove right over to town and sell so he locked me in and
took the skiff and started off towing the raft about half past three i
judged he wouldnt come back that night i waited till i reckoned he had
got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on that log
again before he was tother side of the river i was out of the hole 
him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder 

i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and
shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then i done the same
with the side of bacon then the whisky jug i took all the coffee and
sugar there was and all the ammunition i took the wadding i took the
bucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two
blankets and the skillet and the coffee pot i took fish lines and
matches and other things everything that was worth a cent i cleaned
out the place i wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one out
at the woodpile and i knowed why i was going to leave that i fetched
out the gun and now i was done 

i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
out so many things so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside
by scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and the
sawdust then i fixed the piece of log back into its place and put two
rocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at
that place and didnt quite touch ground if you stood four or five foot
away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never notice it and
besides this was the back of the cabin and it warnt likely anybody
would go fooling around there 

it was all grass clear to the canoe so i hadnt left a track i
followed around to see i stood on the bank and looked out over the
river all safe so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woods 
and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig hogs soon
went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms 
i shot this fellow and took him into camp 

i took the axe and smashed in the door i beat it and hacked it
considerable a doing it i fetched the pig in and took him back nearly
to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him down
on the ground to bleed i say ground because it was ground hard packed 
and no boards well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
in it all i could drag and i started it from the pig and dragged it
to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in and
down it sunk out of sight you could easy see that something had been
dragged over the ground i did wish tom sawyer was there i knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancy
touches nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as
that 

well last i pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good and
stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner then i took
up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldnt drip 
till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the
river now i thought of something else so i went and got the bag of
meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house i
took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom
of it with the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on the place
 pap done everything with his clasp knife about the cooking then i
carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the
willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and
full of rushes and ducks too you might say in the season there was a
slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles
away i dont know where but it didnt go to the river the meal sifted
out and made a little track all the way to the lake i dropped paps
whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done by accident 
then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldnt
leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe again 

it was about dark now so i dropped the canoe down the river under some
willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise i made
fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in
the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan i says to myself theyll
follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the
river for me and theyll follow that meal track to the lake and go
browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that
killed me and took the things they wont ever hunt the river for
anything but my dead carcass theyll soon get tired of that and wont
bother no more about me all right i can stop anywhere i want to 
jacksons island is good enough for me i know that island pretty well 
and nobody ever comes there and then i can paddle over to town nights 
and slink around and pick up things i want jacksons islands the place 

i was pretty tired and the first thing i knowed i was asleep when i
woke up i didnt know where i was for a minute i set up and looked
around a little scared then i remembered the river looked miles and
miles across the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logs
that went a slipping along black and still hundreds of yards out from
shore everything was dead quiet and it looked late and smelt late 
you know what i mean i dont know the words to put it in 

i took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and start
when i heard a sound away over the water i listened pretty soon i
made it out it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
oars working in rowlocks when its a still night i peeped out through
the willow branches and there it was a skiff away across the water i
couldnt tell how many was in it it kept a coming and when it was
abreast of me i see there warnt but one man in it thinks i maybe
its pap though i warnt expecting him he dropped below me with the
current and by and by he came a swinging up shore in the easy water and
he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him well 
it was pap sure enough and sober too by the way he laid his oars 

i didnt lose no time the next minute i was a spinning down stream soft
but quick in the shade of the bank i made two mile and a half and then
struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river 
because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing and people
might see me and hail me i got out amongst the driftwood and then laid
down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float i laid there and had
a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe looking away into the sky not a
cloud in it the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back
in the moonshine i never knowed it before and how far a body can hear
on the water such nights i heard people talking at the ferry landing 
i heard what they said too every word of it one man said it was
getting towards the long days and the short nights now tother one said
this warnt one of the short ones he reckoned and then they laughed 
and he said it over again and they laughed again then they waked up
another fellow and told him and laughed but he didnt laugh he ripped
out something brisk and said let him alone the first fellow said he
lowed to tell it to his old woman she would think it was pretty good 
but he said that warnt nothing to some things he had said in his time 
i heard one man say it was nearly three oclock and he hoped daylight
wouldnt wait more than about a week longer after that the talk got
further and further away and i couldnt make out the words any more but
i could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a
long ways off 

i was away below the ferry now i rose up and there was jacksons
island about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered and
standing up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid like
a steamboat without any lights there warnt any signs of the bar at the
head it was all under water now 

it didnt take me long to get there i shot past the head at a ripping
rate the current was so swift and then i got into the dead water and
landed on the side towards the illinois shore i run the canoe into a
deep dent in the bank that i knowed about i had to part the willow
branches to get in and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
from the outside 

i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out
on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three
mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling a monstrous
big lumber raft was about a mile up stream coming along down with a
lantern in the middle of it i watched it come creeping down and when
it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say stern oars 
there heave her head to stabboard i heard that just as plain as if
the man was by my side 

there was a little gray in the sky now so i stepped into the woods and
laid down for a nap before breakfast 




chapter viii 

the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight
oclock i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied i could
see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big trees all
about and gloomy in there amongst them there was freckled places on
the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and the
freckled places swapped about a little showing there was a little breeze
up there a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very
friendly 

i was powerful lazy and comfortable didnt want to get up and cook
breakfast well i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep
sound of boom away up the river i rouses up and rests on my elbow
and listens pretty soon i hears it again i hopped up and went and
looked out at a hole in the leaves and i see a bunch of smoke laying on
the water a long ways up about abreast the ferry and there was the
ferryboat full of people floating along down i knowed what was the
matter now boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboats
side you see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make my
carcass come to the top 

i was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a fire 
because they might see the smoke so i set there and watched the
cannon smoke and listened to the boom the river was a mile wide there 
and it always looks pretty on a summer morning so i was having a good
enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite to
eat well then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
loaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to the
drownded carcass and stop there so says i ill keep a lookout and if
any of thems floating around after me ill give them a show i changed
to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have and i
warnt disappointed a big double loaf come along and i most got it
with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further of
course i was where the current set in the closest to the shore i knowed
enough for that but by and by along comes another one and this time i
won i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver 
and set my teeth in it was bakers bread what the quality eat none
of your low down corn pone 

i got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munching
the bread and watching the ferry boat and very well satisfied and then
something struck me i says now i reckon the widow or the parson or
somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has gone and
done it so there aint no doubt but there is something in that thing
 that is theres something in it when a body like the widow or the parson
prays but it dont work for me and i reckon it dont work for only just
the right kind 

i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching the
ferryboat was floating with the current and i allowed id have a chance
to see who was aboard when she come along because she would come in
close where the bread did when shed got pretty well along down
towards me i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread 
and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place where the
log forked i could peep through 

by and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they could a
run out a plank and walked ashore most everybody was on the boat pap 
and judge thatcher and bessie thatcher and jo harper and tom sawyer 
and his old aunt polly and sid and mary and plenty more everybody was
talking about the murder but the captain broke in and says 

 look sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe hes
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waters edge i
hope so anyway 

i didnt hope so they all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearly
in my face and kept still watching with all their might i could see
them first rate but they couldnt see me then the captain sung out 

 stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it
made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke and i
judged i was gone if theyd a had some bullets in i reckon theyd a
got the corpse they was after well i see i warnt hurt thanks to
goodness the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
of the island i could hear the booming now and then further and
further off and by and by after an hour i didnt hear it no more the
island was three mile long i judged they had got to the foot and was
giving it up but they didnt yet a while they turned around the foot
of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side under
steam and booming once in a while as they went i crossed over to that
side and watched them when they got abreast the head of the island they
quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the
town 

i knowed i was all right now nobody else would come a hunting after me 
i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
woods i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under
so the rain couldnt get at them i catched a catfish and haggled him
open with my saw and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had
supper then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast 

when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty well
satisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so i went and set
on the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted the
stars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bed 
there aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome you cant
stay so you soon get over it 

and so for three days and nights no difference just the same thing 
but the next day i went exploring around down through the island i was
boss of it it all belonged to me so to say and i wanted to know all
about it but mainly i wanted to put in the time i found plenty
strawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and green
razberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show they
would all come handy by and by i judged 

well i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i warnt far
from the foot of the island i had my gun along but i hadnt shot
nothing it was for protection thought i would kill some game nigh home 
about this time i mighty near stepped on a good sized snake and it went
sliding off through the grass and flowers and i after it trying to get
a shot at it i clipped along and all of a sudden i bounded right on to
the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking 

my heart jumped up amongst my lungs i never waited for to look further 
but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever
i could every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves
and listened but my breath come so hard i couldnt hear nothing else i
slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so
on if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trod on a stick and
broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two
and i only got half and the short half too 

when i got to camp i warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sand in
my craw but i says this aint no time to be fooling around so i got
all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight and i
put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last
years camp and then clumb a tree 

i reckon i was up in the tree two hours but i didnt see nothing i
didnt hear nothing i only thought i heard and seen as much as a
thousand things well i couldnt stay up there forever so at last i
got down but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time 
all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast 

by the time it was night i was pretty hungry so when it was good and
dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
illinois bank about a quarter of a mile i went out in the woods and
cooked a supper and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all
night when i hear a plunkety plunk plunkety plunk and says to myself 
horses coming and next i hear peoples voices i got everything into
the canoe as quick as i could and then went creeping through the woods
to see what i could find out i hadnt got far when i hear a man say 

 we better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is about
beat out lets look around 

i didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy i tied up in the
old place and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe 

i didnt sleep much i couldnt somehow for thinking and every time
i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck so the sleep didnt do
me no good by and by i says to myself i cant live this way im
a going to find out who it is thats here on the island with me ill
find it out or bust well i felt better right off 

so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two and then
let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows the moon was shining 
and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day i poked
along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and sound asleep 
well by this time i was most down to the foot of the island a little
ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as saying the
night was about done i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her
nose to shore then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the
woods i sat down there on a log and looked out through the leaves i
see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river 
but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetops and knowed
the day was coming so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had
run across that camp fire stopping every minute or two to listen but i
hadnt no luck somehow i couldnt seem to find the place but by and
by sure enough i catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees i
went for it cautious and slow by and by i was close enough to have a
look and there laid a man on the ground it most give me the fan tods 
he had a blanket around his head and his head was nearly in the fire i
set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him and kept my
eyes on him steady it was getting gray daylight now pretty soon he
gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket and it was miss
watsons jim i bet i was glad to see him i says 

 hello jim and skipped out 

he bounced up and stared at me wild then he drops down on his knees 
and puts his hands together and says 

 doan hurt me dont i haint ever done no harm to a ghos i alwuz
liked dead people en done all i could for em you go en git in de
river agin whah you blongs en doan do nuffn to ole jim at uz awluz
yo fren 

well i warnt long making him understand i warnt dead i was ever so
glad to see jim i warnt lonesome now i told him i warnt afraid of
him telling the people where i was i talked along but he only set
there and looked at me never said nothing then i says 

 its good daylight les get breakfast make up your camp fire good

 no wy what has you lived on but you got a gun oh yes you got a

so we went over to where the canoe was and while he built a fire in a
grassy open place amongst the trees i fetched meal and bacon and coffee 
and coffee pot and frying pan and sugar and tin cups and the nigger was
set back considerable because he reckoned it was all done with
witchcraft i catched a good big catfish too and jim cleaned him with
his knife and fried him 

when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot 
jim laid it in with all his might for he was most about starved then
when we had got pretty well stuffed we laid off and lazied by and by
jim says 

 but looky here huck who wuz it dat uz killed in dat shanty ef it

then i told him the whole thing and he said it was smart he said tom
sawyer couldnt get up no better plan than what i had then i says

young birds done it i was going to catch some of them but jim wouldnt
let me he said it was death he said his father laid mighty sick once 
and some of them catched a bird and his old granny said his father would
die and he did 

and jim said you mustnt count the things you are going to cook for
dinner because that would bring bad luck the same if you shook the
table cloth after sundown and he said if a man owned a beehive and that
man died the bees must be told about it before sun up next morning or
else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die jim said bees
wouldnt sting idiots but i didnt believe that because i had tried
them lots of times myself and they wouldnt sting me 

i had heard about some of these things before but not all of them jim
knowed all kinds of signs he said he knowed most everything i said it

chapter ix 

i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
that id found when i was exploring so we started and soon got to it 
because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
wide 

this place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot
high we had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep and
the bushes so thick we tramped and clumb around all over it and by and
by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side
towards illinois the cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched
together and jim could stand up straight in it it was cool in there 
jim was for putting our traps in there right away but i said we didnt
want to be climbing up and down there all the time 

jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the traps
in the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island 
and they would never find us without dogs and besides he said them
little birds had said it was going to rain and did i want the things to
get wet 

so we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern and
lugged all the traps up there then we hunted up a place close by to
hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows we took some fish off of
the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinner 

the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one
side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a
good place to build a fire on so we built it there and cooked dinner 

we spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in there 
we put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern pretty soon
it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds was right
about it directly it begun to rain and it rained like all fury too 
and i never see the wind blow so it was one of these regular summer
storms it would get so dark that it looked all blue black outside and
lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a
little ways looked dim and spider webby and here would come a blast of
wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the
leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set
the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild and next 
when it was just about the bluest and blackest fst it was as bright as
glory and youd have a little glimpse of tree tops a plunging about away
off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see
before dark as sin again in a second and now youd hear the thunder let
go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down
the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels
down stairs where its long stairs and they bounce a good deal you
know 

 jim this is nice i says i wouldnt want to be nowhere else but
here pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn bread 

 well you wouldnt a ben here f it hadnt a ben for jim youd a ben
down dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded too dat
you would honey chickens knows when its gwyne to rain en so do de
birds chile 

the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till at
last it was over the banks the water was three or four foot deep on the
island in the low places and on the illinois bottom on that side it was
a good many miles wide but on the missouri side it was the same old
distance across a half a mile because the missouri shore was just a
wall of high bluffs 

daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe it was mighty cool
and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside we
went winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hung
so thick we had to back away and go some other way well on every old
broken down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things and
when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame on
account of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put your hand
on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtles they would
slide off in the water the ridge our cavern was in was full of them 
we could a had pets enough if wed wanted them 

one night we catched a little section of a lumber raft nice pine planks 
it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the
top stood above water six or seven inches a solid level floor we
could see saw logs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them go 
we didnt show ourselves in daylight 

another night when we was up at the head of the island just before
daylight here comes a frame house down on the west side she was a
two story and tilted over considerable we paddled out and got aboard
 clumb in at an upstairs window but it was too dark to see yet so we
made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight 

the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island then we
looked in at the window we could make out a bed and a table and two
old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and there was
clothes hanging against the wall there was something laying on the
floor in the far corner that looked like a man so jim says 

 hello you 

but it didnt budge so i hollered again and then jim says 

 de man aint asleep hes dead you hold still ill go en see 

he went and bent down and looked and says 

 its a dead man yes indeedy naked too hes ben shot in de back 
i reckn hes ben dead two er three days come in huck but doan look
at his face its too gashly 

i didnt look at him at all jim throwed some old rags over him but he
neednt done it i didnt want to see him there was heaps of old greasy
cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottles and a
couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the walls was the
ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal there was two
old dirty calico dresses and a sun bonnet and some womens underclothes
hanging against the wall and some mens clothing too we put the lot
into the canoe it might come good there was a boys old speckled straw
hat on the floor i took that too and there was a bottle that had had
milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck we would a took
the bottle but it was broke there was a seedy old chest and an old
hair trunk with the hinges broke they stood open but there warnt
nothing left in them that was any account the way things was scattered
about we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warnt fixed so as to
carry off most of their stuff 

we got an old tin lantern and a butcher knife without any handle and a
bran new barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallow
candles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratty
old bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins and
beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet
and some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some
monstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dog collar 
and a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no label on
them and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good curry comb and
jim he found a ratty old fiddle bow and a wooden leg the straps was
broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg though it
was too long for me and not long enough for jim and we couldnt find the
other one though we hunted all around 

and so take it all around we made a good haul when we was ready to
shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretty
broad day so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
quilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways
off i paddled over to the illinois shore and drifted down most a half
a mile doing it i crept up the dead water under the bank and hadnt no
accidents and didnt see nobody we got home all safe 




chapter x 

after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
come to be killed but jim didnt want to he said it would fetch bad
luck and besides he said he might come and hant us he said a man
that warnt buried was more likely to go a hanting around than one that
was planted and comfortable that sounded pretty reasonable so i didnt
say no more but i couldnt keep from studying over it and wishing i
knowed who shot the man and what they done it for 

we rummaged the clothes wed got and found eight dollars in silver sewed
up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat jim said he reckoned the
people in that house stole the coat because if theyd a knowed the money
was there they wouldnt a left it i said i reckoned they killed him 
too but jim didnt want to talk about that i says 

 now you think its bad luck but what did you say when i fetched in the
snake skin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday 
you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake skin
with my hands well heres your bad luck weve raked in all this
truck and eight dollars besides i wish we could have some bad luck like
this every day jim 

 never you mind honey never you mind dont you git too peart its
a comin mind i tell you its a comin 

it did come too it was a tuesday that we had that talk well after
dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
ridge and got out of tobacco i went to the cavern to get some and
found a rattlesnake in there i killed him and curled him up on the
foot of jims blanket ever so natural thinking thered be some fun when
jim found him there well by night i forgot all about the snake and
when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the
snakes mate was there and bit him 

he jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the
varmint curled up and ready for another spring i laid him out in a
second with a stick and jim grabbed paps whisky jug and begun to pour
it down 

he was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel that all
comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it jim told
me to chop off the snakes head and throw it away and then skin the body
and roast a piece of it i done it and he eat it and said it would help
cure him he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist 
too he said that that would help then i slid out quiet and throwed
the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for i warnt going to let jim
find out it was all my fault not if i could help it 

jim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of his head
and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went
to sucking at the jug again his foot swelled up pretty big and so did
his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judged he was
all right but id druther been bit with a snake than paps whisky 

jim was laid up for four days and nights then the swelling was all gone
and he was around again i made up my mind i wouldnt ever take a holt
of a snake skin again with my hands now that i see what had come of it 
jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time and he said that
handling a snake skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnt got to
the end of it yet he said he druther see the new moon over his left
shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake skin in his
hand well i was getting to feel that way myself though ive always
reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of
the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do old hank bunker
done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years he got
drunk and fell off of the shot tower and spread himself out so that he
was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways
between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so so they say but
i didnt see it pap told me but anyway it all come of looking at the
moon that way like a fool 

well the days went along and the river went down between its banks
again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks
with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a
man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds 
we couldnt handle him of course he would a flung us into illinois we
just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded we
found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lots of
rubbage we split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool
in it jim said hed had it there a long time to coat it over so and
make a ball of it it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the
mississippi i reckon jim said he hadnt ever seen a bigger one he
would a been worth a good deal over at the village they peddle out such
a fish as that by the pound in the market house there everybody buys
some of him his meats as white as snow and makes a good fry 

next morning i said it was getting slow and dull and i wanted to get a
stirring up some way i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and
find out what was going on jim liked that notion but he said i must go
in the dark and look sharp then he studied it over and said couldnt i
put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl that was a good
notion too so we shortened up one of the calico gowns and i turned up
my trouser legs to my knees and got into it jim hitched it behind with
the hooks and it was a fair fit i put on the sun bonnet and tied it
under my chin and then for a body to look in and see my face was like
looking down a joint of stove pipe jim said nobody would know me even
in the daytime hardly i practiced around all day to get the hang of
the things and by and by i could do pretty well in them only jim said i
didnt walk like a girl and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to
get at my britches pocket i took notice and done better 

i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark 

i started across to the town from a little below the ferry landing and
the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town i tied
up and started along the bank there was a light burning in a little
shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and i wondered who had
took up quarters there i slipped up and peeped in at the window there
was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was
on a pine table i didnt know her face she was a stranger for you
couldnt start a face in that town that i didnt know now this was
lucky because i was weakening i was getting afraid i had come people
might know my voice and find me out but if this woman had been in such
a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted to know so i
knocked at the door and made up my mind i wouldnt forget i was a girl 




chapter xi 

 come in says the woman and i did she says take a cheer 

i done it she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and says 

 what might your name be 

 sarah williams 

 where bouts do you live in this neighborhood 

 nom in hookerville seven mile below ive walked all the way and
im all tired out 

 hungry too i reckon ill find you something 

 nom i aint hungry i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below
here at a farm so i aint hungry no more its what makes me so late 
my mothers down sick and out of money and everything and i come to
tell my uncle abner moore he lives at the upper end of the town she
says i haint ever been here before do you know him 

 no but i dont know everybody yet i havent lived here quite two
weeks its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town you better
stay here all night take off your bonnet 

 no i says ill rest a while i reckon and go on i aint afeared
of the dark 

she said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be in by
and by maybe in a hour and a half and shed send him along with me 
then she got to talking about her husband and about her relations up the
river and her relations down the river and about how much better off
they used to was and how they didnt know but theyd made a mistake
coming to our town instead of letting well alone and so on and so on 
till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was
going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder 
and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along she told
about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it
ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and what a hard lot i
was and at last she got down to where i was murdered i says 

 who done it weve heard considerable about these goings on down in
hookerville but we dont know who twas that killed huck finn 

 well i reckon theres a right smart chance of people here thatd like
to know who killed him some think old finn done it himself 

 no is that so 

 most everybody thought it at first hell never know how nigh he come
to getting lynched but before night they changed around and judged it
was done by a runaway nigger named jim 

 why he 

i stopped i reckoned i better keep still she run on and never
noticed i had put in at all 

 the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed so theres a
reward out for him three hundred dollars and theres a reward out for
old finn too two hundred dollars you see he come to town the morning
after the murder and told about it and was out with em on the
ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left before night they
wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see well next day they found
out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen sence ten
oclock the night the murder was done so then they put it on him you
see and while they was full of it next day back comes old finn and
went boo hooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all
over illinois with the judge gave him some and that evening he got
drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
hard looking strangers and then went off with them well he haint
come back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thing
blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
fixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed get
hucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit people
do say he warnt any too good to do it oh hes sly i reckon if he
dont come back for a year hell be all right you cant prove anything
on him you know everything will be quieted down then and hell walk in
hucks money as easy as nothing 

 yes i reckon so m i dont see nothing in the way of it has
everybody quit thinking the nigger done it 

 oh no not everybody a good many thinks he done it but theyll get
the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him 

 why are they after him yet 

 well youre innocent aint you does three hundred dollars lay around
every day for people to pick up some folks think the nigger aint far
from here im one of them but i haint talked it around a few days
ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log
shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island
over yonder that they call jacksons island dont anybody live there 
says i no nobody says they i didnt say any more but i done some
thinking i was pretty near certain id seen smoke over there about the
head of the island a day or two before that so i says to myself like
as not that niggers hiding over there anyway says i its worth the
trouble to give the place a hunt i haint seen any smoke sence so i
reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbands going over to see
 him and another man he was gone up the river but he got back to day 
and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago 

i had got so uneasy i couldnt set still i had to do something with my
hands so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it 
my hands shook and i was making a bad job of it when the woman stopped
talking i looked up and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling
a little i put down the needle and thread and let on to be interested
 and i was too and says 

 three hundred dollars is a power of money i wish my mother could get
it is your husband going over there to night 

 oh yes he went up town with the man i was telling you of to get a
boat and see if they could borrow another gun theyll go over after
midnight 

 couldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytime 

 yes and couldnt the nigger see better too after midnight hell
likely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up
his camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got one 

 i didnt think of that 

the woman kept looking at me pretty curious and i didnt feel a bit
comfortable pretty soon she says 

 what did you say your name was honey 

 m mary williams 

somehow it didnt seem to me that i said it was mary before so i didnt
look up seemed to me i said it was sarah so i felt sort of cornered 
and was afeared maybe i was looking it too i wished the woman would
say something more the longer she set still the uneasier i was but now
she says 

 honey i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in 

 oh yesm i did sarah mary williams sarahs my first name some
calls me sarah some calls me mary 

 oh thats the way of it 

 yesm 

i was feeling better then but i wished i was out of there anyway i
couldnt look up yet 

well the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poor
they had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
place and so forth and so on and then i got easy again she was right
about the rats youd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
every little while she said she had to have things handy to throw at
them when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace she showed
me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shot
with it generly but shed wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didnt
know whether she could throw true now but she watched for a chance and
directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and said ouch 
it hurt her arm so then she told me to try for the next one i wanted
to be getting away before the old man got back but of course i didnt
let on i got the thing and the first rat that showed his nose i let
drive and if hed a stayed where he was hed a been a tolerable sick
rat she said that was first rate and she reckoned i would hive the
next one she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and
brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with i
held up my two hands and she put the hank over them and went on talking
about her and her husbands matters but she broke off to say 

 keep your eye on the rats you better have the lead in your lap 
handy 

so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and i clapped my
legs together on it and she went on talking but only about a minute 
then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face and very
pleasant and says 

 come now whats your real name 

 wh what mum 

 whats your real name is it bill or tom or bob or what is it 

i reckon i shook like a leaf and i didnt know hardly what to do but i
says 

 please to dont poke fun at a poor girl like me mum if im in the way
here ill 

 no you wont set down and stay where you are i aint going to hurt
you and i aint going to tell on you nuther you just tell me your
secret and trust me ill keep it and whats more ill help you 
soll my old man if you want him to you see youre a runaway
prentice thats all it aint anything there aint no harm in it 
youve been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut bless you 
child i wouldnt tell on you tell me all about it now thats a good
boy 

so i said it wouldnt be no use to try to play it any longer and i would
just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musnt go back
on her promise then i told her my father and mother was dead and the
law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back
from the river and he treated me so bad i couldnt stand it no longer 
he went away to be gone a couple of days and so i took my chance and
stole some of his daughters old clothes and cleared out and i had been
three nights coming the thirty miles i traveled nights and hid
daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home
lasted me all the way and i had a plenty i said i believed my uncle
abner moore would take care of me and so that was why i struck out for
this town of goshen 

 goshen child this aint goshen this is st petersburg goshens
ten mile further up the river who told you this was goshen 

 why a man i met at daybreak this morning just as i was going to turn
into the woods for my regular sleep he told me when the roads forked i
must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to goshen 

 he was drunk i reckon he told you just exactly wrong 

 well he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now i got
to be moving along ill fetch goshen before daylight 

 hold on a minute ill put you up a snack to eat you might want it 

so she put me up a snack and says 

 say when a cows laying down which end of her gets up first answer
up prompt now dont stop to study over it which end gets up first 

 the hind end mum 

 well then a horse 

 the forrard end mum 

 which side of a tree does the moss grow on 

 north side 

 if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with
their heads pointed the same direction 

 the whole fifteen mum 

 well i reckon you have lived in the country i thought maybe you was
trying to hocus me again whats your real name now 

 george peters mum 

 well try to remember it george dont forget and tell me its
elexander before you go and then get out by saying its george elexander
when i catch you and dont go about women in that old calico you do a
girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe bless you child 
when you set out to thread a needle dont hold the thread still and fetch
the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it 
thats the way a woman most always does but a man always does tother
way and when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe
and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss
your rat about six or seven foot throw stiff armed from the shoulder 
like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the
wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy and mind
you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees
apart she dont clap them together the way you did when you catched the
lump of lead why i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the
needle and i contrived the other things just to make certain now trot
along to your uncle sarah mary williams george elexander peters and if
you get into trouble you send word to mrs judith loftus which is me 
and ill do what i can to get you out of it keep the river road all the
way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you the river
roads a rocky one and your feetll be in a condition when you get to
goshen i reckon 

i went up the bank about fifty yards and then i doubled on my tracks and
slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house i
jumped in and was off in a hurry i went up stream far enough to make
the head of the island and then started across i took off the
sun bonnet for i didnt want no blinders on then when i was about the
middle i heard the clock begin to strike so i stops and listens the
sound come faint over the water but clear eleven when i struck the
head of the island i never waited to blow though i was most winded but
i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and started
a good fire there on a high and dry spot 

then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half
below as hard as i could go i landed and slopped through the timber
and up the ridge and into the cavern there jim laid sound asleep on
the ground i roused him out and says 

 git up and hump yourself jim there aint a minute to lose theyre
after us 

jim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way he worked
for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared by that time
everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be
shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid we put out the camp
fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show a candle outside
after that 

i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look but
if there was a boat around i couldnt see it for stars and shadows aint
good to see by then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the
shade past the foot of the island dead still never saying a word 




chapter xii 

it must a been close on to one oclock when we got below the island at
last and the raft did seem to go mighty slow if a boat was to come
along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore 
and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought to put the
gun in the canoe or a fishing line or anything to eat we was in
ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things it warnt good
judgment to put everything on the raft 

if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i
built and watched it all night for jim to come anyways they stayed
away from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt no
fault of mine i played it as low down on them as i could 

when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
big bend on the illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches with
the hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there
had been a cave in in the bank there a tow head is a sandbar that has
cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow teeth 

we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois
side and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so we
warnt afraid of anybody running across us we laid there all day and
watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore and
up bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle i told jim all
about the time i had jabbering with that woman and jim said she was a
smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt set down
and watch a camp fire no sir shed fetch a dog well then i said 
why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog jim said he bet she
did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and he believed
they must a gone up town to get a dog and so they lost all that time or
else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the
village no indeedy we would be in that same old town again so i said
i didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as long as they
didnt 

when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
cottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sight 
so jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam
to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the things dry 
jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more above the
level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach
of steamboat waves right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of
dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it
to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly 
the wigwam would keep it from being seen we made an extra steering oar 
too because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something 
we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on because we
must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming
down stream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt have to light
it for up stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a
 crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks being still
a little under water so up bound boats didnt always run the channel 
but hunted easy water 

this second night we run between seven and eight hours with a current
that was making over four mile an hour we catched fish and talked and
we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness it was kind of
solemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs looking
up at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and it warnt
often that we laughed only a little kind of a low chuckle we had
mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened to us
at all that night nor the next nor the next 

every night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsides 
nothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see the
fifth night we passed st louis and it was like the whole world lit up 
in st petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
people in st louis but i never believed it till i see that wonderful
spread of lights at two oclock that still night there warnt a sound
there everybody was asleep 

every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten oclock at some little
village and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or other
stuff to eat and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warnt roosting
comfortable and took him along pap always said take a chicken when
you get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easy
find somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot i never see
pap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used to
say anyway 

mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things of
that kind pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow things if you was
meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warnt anything
but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it jim said
he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right so the
best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list
and say we wouldnt borrow them any more then he reckoned it wouldnt be
no harm to borrow the others so we talked it over all one night 
drifting along down the river trying to make up our minds whether to
drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what but
towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to
drop crabapples and psimmons we warnt feeling just right before that 
but it was all comfortable now i was glad the way it come out too 
because crabapples aint ever good and the psimmons wouldnt be ripe
for two or three months yet 

we shot a water fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or
didnt go to bed early enough in the evening take it all round we
lived pretty high 

the fifth night below st louis we had a big storm after midnight with a
power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solid
sheet we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself 
when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead 
and high rocky bluffs on both sides by and by says i hel lo jim 
looky yonder it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock we
was drifting straight down for her the lightning showed her very
distinct she was leaning over with part of her upper deck above water 
and you could see every little chimbly guy clean and clear and a chair
by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when
the flashes come 

well it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysterious like 
i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck
laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river i
wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see what there
was there so i says 

 les land on her jim 

but jim was dead against it at first he says 

 i doan want to go fooln long er no wrack wes doin blame well en
we better let blame well alone as de good book says like as not deys
a watchman on dat wrack 

 watchman your grandmother i says there aint nothing to watch but
the texas and the pilot house and do you reckon anybodys going to resk
his life for a texas and a pilot house such a night as this when its
likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute jim couldnt
say nothing to that so he didnt try and besides i says we might
borrow something worth having out of the captains stateroom seegars i
bet you and cost five cents apiece solid cash steamboat captains is
always rich and get sixty dollars a month and they dont care a cent
what a thing costs you know long as they want it stick a candle in
your pocket i cant rest jim till we give her a rummaging do you
reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing not for pie he wouldnt 
hed call it an adventure thats what hed call it and hed land on
that wreck if it was his last act and wouldnt he throw style into it 
 wouldnt he spread himself nor nothing why youd think it was
christopher clumbus discovering kingdom come i wish tom sawyer was
here 

jim he grumbled a little but give in he said we mustnt talk any more
than we could help and then talk mighty low the lightning showed us
the wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick and
made fast there 

the deck was high out here we went sneaking down the slope of it to
labboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with our
feet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was so
dark we couldnt see no sign of them pretty soon we struck the forward
end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us in
front of the captains door which was open and by jimminy away down
through the texas hall we see a light and all in the same second we seem
to hear low voices in yonder 

jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to come
along i says all right and was going to start for the raft but just
then i heard a voice wail out and say 

 oh please dont boys i swear i wont ever tell 

another voice said pretty loud 

 its a lie jim turner youve acted this way before you always want
moren your share of the truck and youve always got it too because
youve swore t if you didnt youd tell but this time youve said it
jest one time too many youre the meanest treacherousest hound in this
country 

by this time jim was gone for the raft i was just a biling with
curiosity and i says to myself tom sawyer wouldnt back out now and so
i wont either im a going to see whats going on here so i dropped on
my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aft in the dark till
there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross hall of the
texas then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand
and foot and two men standing over him and one of them had a dim
lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol this one kept
pointing the pistol at the mans head on the floor and saying 

 id like to and i orter too a mean skunk 

the man on the floor would shrivel up and say oh please dont bill i
haint ever goin to tell 

and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say 

 deed you aint you never said no truer thing n that you bet you 
and once he said hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got the best of
him and tied him hed a killed us both and what for jist for nothn 
jist because we stood on our rights thats what for but i lay you
aint a goin to threaten nobody any more jim turner put up that
pistol bill 

bill says 

 i dont want to jake packard im for killin him and didnt he kill
old hatfield jist the same way and dont he deserve it 

 but i dont want him killed and ive got my reasons for it 

 bless yo heart for them words jake packard ill never forgit you
longs i live says the man on the floor sort of blubbering 

packard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nail
and started towards where i was there in the dark and motioned bill to
come i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards but the boat
slanted so that i couldnt make very good time so to keep from getting
run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side the
man came a pawing along in the dark and when packard got to my
stateroom he says 

 here come in here 

and in he come and bill after him but before they got in i was up in
the upper berth cornered and sorry i come then they stood there with
their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked i couldnt see them 
but i could tell where they was by the whisky theyd been having i was
glad i didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much difference anyway 
because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because i didnt
breathe i was too scared and besides a body couldnt breathe and
hear such talk they talked low and earnest bill wanted to kill
turner he says 

 hes said hell tell and he will if we was to give both our shares to
him now it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the way weve
served him shores youre born hell turn states evidence now you
hear me im for putting him out of his troubles 

 som i says packard very quiet 

 blame it id sorter begun to think you wasnt well then thats all
right les go and do it 

 hold on a minute i haint had my say yit you listen to me 
shootings good but theres quieter ways if the things got to be done 
but what i say is this it aint good sense to go courtn around after a
halter if you can git at what youre up to in some way thats jist as
good and at the same time dont bring you into no resks aint that so 

 you bet it is but how you goin to manage it this time 

 well my idea is this well rustle around and gather up whatever
pickins weve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hide
the truck then well wait now i say it aint a goin to be moren two
hours befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river see 
hell be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his own
self i reckon thats a considerble sight better n killin of him im
unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it aint
good sense it aint good morals aint i right 

 yes i reckn you are but spose she dont break up and wash off 

 well we can wait the two hours anyway and see cant we 

 all right then come along 

so they started and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambled
forward it was dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coarse
whisper jim and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of a
moan and i says 

 quick jim it aint no time for fooling around and moaning theres a
gang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and set
her drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from the
wreck theres one of em going to be in a bad fix but if we find their
boat we can put all of em in a bad fix for the sheriff ll get em 
quick hurry ill hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard 
you start at the raft and 

 oh my lordy lordy raf dey ain no raf no mo she done broke
loose en gone i en here we is 




chapter xiii 

well i catched my breath and most fainted shut up on a wreck with such
a gang as that but it warnt no time to be sentimentering wed got to
find that boat now had to have it for ourselves so we went a quaking
and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it was too seemed a
week before we got to the stern no sign of a boat jim said he didnt
believe he could go any further so scared he hadnt hardly any strength
left he said but i said come on if we get left on this wreck we are
in a fix sure so on we prowled again we struck for the stern of the
texas and found it and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight 
hanging on from shutter to shutter for the edge of the skylight was in
the water when we got pretty close to the cross hall door there was the
skiff sure enough i could just barely see her i felt ever so
thankful in another second i would a been aboard of her but just then
the door opened one of the men stuck his head out only about a couple
of foot from me and i thought i was gone but he jerked it in again and
says 

 heave that blame lantern out o sight bill 

he flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself and
set down it was packard then bill he come out and got in packard
says in a low voice 

 all ready shove off 

i couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters i was so weak but bill says 

 hold on d you go through him 

 no didnt you 

 no so hes got his share o the cash yet 

 well then come along no use to take truck and leave money 

 say wont he suspicion what were up to 

 maybe he wont but we got to have it anyway come along 

so they got out and went in 

the door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a half
second i was in the boat and jim come tumbling after me i out with my
knife and cut the rope and away we went 

we didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly even
breathe we went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of the
paddle box and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a
hundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up every last
sign of her and we was safe and knowed it 

when we was three or four hundred yards down stream we see the lantern
show like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowed by
that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning to
understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner was 

then jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft now was the
first time that i begun to worry about the men i reckon i hadnt had
time to before i begun to think how dreadful it was even for
murderers to be in such a fix i says to myself there aint no telling
but i might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how would i like
it so says i to jim 

 the first light we see well land a hundred yards below it or above it 
in a place where its a good hiding place for you and the skiff and then
ill go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for that
gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their
time comes 

but that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and
this time worse than ever the rain poured down and never a light
showed everybody in bed i reckon we boomed along down the river 
watching for lights and watching for our raft after a long time the
rain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimpering 
and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and we
made for it 

it was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again we
seen a light now away down to the right on shore so i said i would go
for it the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
there on the wreck we hustled it on to the raft in a pile and i told
jim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had gone
about two mile and keep it burning till i come then i manned my oars
and shoved for the light as i got down towards it three or four more
showed up on a hillside it was a village i closed in above the shore
light and laid on my oars and floated as i went by i see it was a
lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double hull ferryboat i skimmed
around for the watchman a wondering whereabouts he slept and by and by
i found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down between his
knees i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun to cry 

he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was only
me he took a good gap and stretch and then he says 

 hello whats up dont cry bub whats the trouble 

i says 

 pap and mam and sis and 

then i broke down he says 

 oh dang it now dont take on so we all has to have our troubles and
this n ll come out all right whats the matter with em 

 theyre theyre are you the watchman of the boat 

 yes he says kind of pretty well satisfied like im the captain and
the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck hand and
sometimes im the freight and passengers i aint as rich as old jim
hornback and i cant be so blame generous and good to tom dick and
harry as what he is and slam around money the way he does but ive told
him a many a time t i wouldnt trade places with him for says i a
sailors lifes the life for me and im derned if id live two mile out
o town where there aint nothing ever goin on not for all his
spondulicks and as much more on top of it says i 

i broke in and says 

 theyre in an awful peck of trouble and 

 who is 

 why pap and mam and sis and miss hooker and if youd take your
ferryboat and go up there 

 up where where are they 

 on the wreck 

 what wreck 

 why there aint but one 

 what you dont mean the walter scott 

 yes 

 good land what are they doin there for gracious sakes 

 well they didnt go there a purpose 

 i bet they didnt why great goodness there aint no chance for em
if they dont git off mighty quick why how in the nation did they ever
git into such a scrape 

 easy enough miss hooker was a visiting up there to the town 

 yes booths landing go on 

 she was a visiting there at booths landing and just in the edge of the
evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse ferry to stay
all night at her friends house miss what you may call her i disremember
her name and they lost their steering oar and swung around and went
a floating down stern first about two mile and saddle baggsed on the
wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost 
but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck well about an
hour after dark we come along down in our trading scow and it was so
dark we didnt notice the wreck till we was right on it and so we
saddle baggsed but all of us was saved but bill whipple and oh he was
the best cretur i most wish t it had been me i do 

 my george its the beatenest thing i ever struck and then what did
you all do 

 well we hollered and took on but its so wide there we couldnt make
nobody hear so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help
somehow i was the only one that could swim so i made a dash for it and
miss hooker she said if i didnt strike help sooner come here and hunt
up her uncle and hed fix the thing i made the land about a mile
below and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to do
something but they said what in such a night and such a current 
there aint no sense in it go for the steam ferry now if youll go
and 

 by jackson id like to and blame it i dont know but i will but who
in the dingnations a going to pay for it do you reckon your pap 

 why thats all right miss hooker she tole me particular that her
uncle hornback 

 great guns is he her uncle looky here you break for that light over
yonder way and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of
a mile out youll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to jim
hornbacks and hell foot the bill and dont you fool around any 
because hell want to know the news tell him ill have his niece all
safe before he can get to town hump yourself now im a going up
around the corner here to roust out my engineer 

i struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner i went back
and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the
easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in among some
woodboats for i couldnt rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start 
but take it all around i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of
taking all this trouble for that gang for not many would a done it i
wished the widow knowed about it i judged she would be proud of me for
helping these rapscallions because rapscallions and dead beats is the
kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in 

well before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding along
down a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out for
her she was very deep and i see in a minute there warnt much chance
for anybody being alive in her i pulled all around her and hollered a
little but there wasnt any answer all dead still i felt a little bit
heavy hearted about the gang but not much for i reckoned if they could
stand it i could 

then here comes the ferryboat so i shoved for the middle of the river on
a long down stream slant and when i judged i was out of eye reach i laid
on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for
miss hookers remainders because the captain would know her uncle
hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up
and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went a booming down
the river 

it did seem a powerful long time before jims light showed up and when
it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off by the time i got
there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so we
struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turned in
and slept like dead people 




chapter xiv 

by and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stole
off of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and all
sorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and three
boxes of seegars we hadnt ever been this rich before in neither of our
lives the seegars was prime we laid off all the afternoon in the
woods talking and me reading the books and having a general good time 
i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat 
and i said these kinds of things was adventures but he said he didnt
want no more adventures he said that when i went in the texas and he
crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died 
because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed for if
he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if he did get saved 
whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward and
then miss watson would sell him south sure well he was right he was
most always right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger 

i read considerable to jim about kings and dukes and earls and such and
how gaudy they dressed and how much style they put on and called each
other your majesty and your grace and your lordship and so on stead
of mister and jims eyes bugged out and he was interested he says 

 i didn know dey was so many un um i haint hearn bout none un um 
skasely but ole king sollermun onless you counts dem kings dats in a
pack er kyards how much do a king git

 of course it is they just set around except maybe when theres a
war then they go to the war but other times they just lazy around or
go hawking just hawking and sp sh d you hear a noise 

we skipped out and looked but it warnt nothing but the flutter of a
steamboats wheel away down coming around the point so we come back 

 yes says i and other times when things is dull they fuss with the
parlyment and if everybody dont go just so he whacks their heads off 
but mostly they hang round the harem

so i quit 




chapter xv 

we judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo at the bottom
of illinois where the ohio river comes in and that was what we was
after we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the
ohio amongst the free states and then be out of trouble 

well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead
to tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when i paddled
ahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anything but
little saplings to tie to i passed the line around one of them right on
the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft
come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she
went i see the fog closing down and it made me so sick and scared i
couldnt budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me and then there
warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards i jumped into
the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her
back a stroke but she didnt come i was in such a hurry i hadnt
untied her i got up and tried to untie her but i was so excited my
hands shook so i couldnt hardly do anything with them 

as soon as i got started i took out after the raft hot and heavy right
down the towhead that was all right as far as it went but the towhead
warnt sixty yards long and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot
out into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way i was
going than a dead man 

thinks i it wont do to paddle first i know ill run into the bank or a
towhead or something i got to set still and float and yet its mighty
fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time i
whooped and listened away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop 
and up comes my spirits i went tearing after it listening sharp to
hear it again the next time it come i see i warnt heading for it but
heading away to the right of it and the next time i was heading away to
the left of it and not gaining on it much either for i was flying
around this way and that and tother but it was going straight ahead
all the time 

i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the
time but he never did and it was the still places between the whoops
that was making the trouble for me well i fought along and directly i
hears the whoop behind me i was tangled good now that was somebody
elses whoop or else i was turned around 

i throwed the paddle down i heard the whoop again it was behind me
yet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing its
place and i kept answering till by and by it was in front of me again 
and i knowed the current had swung the canoes head down stream and i
was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering i
couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont look
natural nor sound natural in a fog 

the whooping went on and in about a minute i come a booming down on a
cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwed me
off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared 
the currrent was tearing by them so swift 

in another second or two it was solid white and still again i set
perfectly still then listening to my heart thump and i reckon i didnt
draw a breath while it thumped a hundred 

i just give up then i knowed what the matter was that cut bank was an
island and jim had gone down tother side of it it warnt no towhead
that you could float by in ten minutes it had the big timber of a
regular island it might be five or six miles long and more than half a
mile wide 

i kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes i reckon i
was floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you dont
ever think of that no you feel like you are laying dead still on the
water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think to
yourself how fast youre going but you catch your breath and think my 
how that snags tearing along if you think it aint dismal and lonesome
out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try it once youll
see 

next for about a half an hour i whoops now and then at last i hears
the answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but i couldnt do it 
and directly i judged id got into a nest of towheads for i had little
dim glimpses of them on both sides of me sometimes just a narrow channel
between and some that i couldnt see i knowed was there because id hear
the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung
over the banks well i warnt long loosing the whoops down amongst the
towheads and i only tried to chase them a little while anyway because
it was worse than chasing a jack o lantern you never knowed a sound
dodge around so and swap places so quick and so much 

i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times to
keep from knocking the islands out of the river and so i judged the raft
must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get
further ahead and clear out of hearing it was floating a little faster
than what i was 

well i seemed to be in the open river again by and by but i couldnt
hear no sign of a whoop nowheres i reckoned jim had fetched up on a
snag maybe and it was all up with him i was good and tired so i laid
down in the canoe and said i wouldnt bother no more i didnt want to
go to sleep of course but i was so sleepy i couldnt help it so i
thought i would take jest one little cat nap 

but i reckon it was more than a cat nap for when i waked up the stars
was shining bright the fog was all gone and i was spinning down a big
bend stern first first i didnt know where i was i thought i was
dreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up
dim out of last week 

it was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind
of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as i could see by the
stars i looked away down stream and seen a black speck on the water 
i took after it but when i got to it it warnt nothing but a couple of
sawlogs made fast together then i see another speck and chased that 
then another and this time i was right it was the raft 

when i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between his
knees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steering oar the
other oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves and
branches and dirt so shed had a rough time 

i made fast and laid down under jims nose on the raft and began to gap 
and stretch my fists out against jim and says 

 hello jim have i been asleep why didnt you stir me up 

 goodness gracious is dat you huck en you ain dead you ain
drownded yous back agin its too good for true honey its too
good for true lemme look at you chile lemme feel o you no you ain

 why de fog de fog dats been aroun all night en didnt you whoop 
en didnt i whoop tell we got mix up in de islands en one un us got
los en tother one was jis as good as los kase he didn know whah he
wuz en didnt i bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible
time en mos git drownded now ain dat so boss aint it so you
answer me dat 

 well this is too many for me jim i haint seen no fog nor no
islands nor no troubles nor nothing i been setting here talking with
you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago and i reckon
i done the same you couldnt a got drunk in that time so of course
youve been dreaming 

 dad fetch it how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes 

 well hang it all you did dream it because there didnt any of it
happen 

 but huck its all jis as plain to me as 

 it dont make no difference how plain it is there aint nothing in it 
i know because ive been here all the time 

jim didnt say nothing for about five minutes but set there studying
over it then he says 

 well den i reckn i did dream it huck but dog my cats ef it aint de
powerfullest dream i ever see en i haint ever had no dream bfo dats
tired me like dis one 

 oh well thats all right because a dream does tire a body like
everything sometimes but this one was a staving dream tell me all
about it jim 

so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it
happened only he painted it up considerable then he said he must start
in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning he said the
first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the
current was another man that would get us away from him the whoops was
warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnt try
hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into bad luck 
stead of keeping us out of it the lot of towheads was troubles we was
going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks 
but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravate them we
would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river 
which was the free states and wouldnt have no more trouble 

it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft but it was
clearing up again now 

 oh well thats all interpreted well enough as far as it goes jim i
says but what does these things stand for 

it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar you could
see them first rate now 

jim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trash
again he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldnt
seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right
away but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me
steady without ever smiling and says 

 what do dey stan for ise gwyne to tell you when i got all wore out
wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos
broke bekase you wuz los en i didn kyer no mo what become er me en
de raf en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de
tears come en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo foot is so
thankful en all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make a fool uv
ole jim wid a lie dat truck dah is trash en trash is what people is
dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes em ashamed 

then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without
saying anything but that but that was enough it made me feel so mean
i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back 

it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble
myself to a nigger but i done it and i warnt ever sorry for it
afterwards neither i didnt do him no more mean tricks and i wouldnt
done that one if id a knowed it would make him feel that way 




chapter xvi 

we slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind a
monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession she had
four long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirty
men likely she had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an open
camp fire in the middle and a tall flag pole at each end there was a
power of style about her it amounted to something being a raftsman on
such a craft as that 

we went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and got
hot the river was very wide and was walled with solid timber on both
sides you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light we talked
about cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it i
said likely we wouldnt because i had heard say there warnt but about a
dozen houses there and if they didnt happen to have them lit up how
was we going to know we was passing a town jim said if the two big
rivers joined together there that would show but i said maybe we might
think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old
river again that disturbed jim and me too so the question was what
to do i said paddle ashore the first time a light showed and tell
them pap was behind coming along with a trading scow and was a green
hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was to cairo jim
thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and waited 

there warnt nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town and
not pass it without seeing it he said hed be mighty sure to see it 
because hed be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed it
hed be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom every
little while he jumps up and says 

 dah she is 

but it warnt it was jack o lanterns or lightning bugs so he set
down again and went to watching same as before jim said it made him
all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom well i can
tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear him 
because i begun to get it through my head that he was most free and who
was to blame for it why me i couldnt get that out of my conscience 
no how nor no way it got to troubling me so i couldnt rest i couldnt
stay still in one place it hadnt ever come home to me before what
this thing was that i was doing but now it did and it stayed with me 
and scorched me more and more i tried to make out to myself that i
warnt to blame because i didnt run jim off from his rightful owner 
but it warnt no use conscience up and says every time but you knowed
he was running for his freedom and you could a paddled ashore and told
somebody that was so i couldnt get around that noway that was
where it pinched conscience says to me what had poor miss watson done
to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and
never say one single word what did that poor old woman do to you that
you could treat her so mean why she tried to learn you your book she
tried to learn you your manners she tried to be good to you every way
she knowed how thats what she done 

i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead i
fidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and jim was
fidgeting up and down past me we neither of us could keep still every
time he danced around and says dahs cairo it went through me like a
shot and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die of
miserableness 

jim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself he was
saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he
would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when he
got enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close to
where miss watson lived and then they would both work to buy the two
children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get an
ablitionist to go and steal them 

it most froze me to hear such talk he wouldnt ever dared to talk such
talk in his life before just see what a difference it made in him the
minute he judged he was about free it was according to the old saying 
 give a nigger an inch and hell take an ell thinks i this is what
comes of my not thinking here was this nigger which i had as good as
helped to run away coming right out flat footed and saying he would
steal his children children that belonged to a man i didnt even know a
man that hadnt ever done me no harm 

i was sorry to hear jim say that it was such a lowering of him my
conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last i says
to it let up on me it aint too late yet ill paddle ashore at the
first light and tell i felt easy and happy and light as a feather
right off all my troubles was gone i went to looking out sharp for a
light and sort of singing to myself by and by one showed jim sings
out 

 wes safe huck wes safe jump up and crack yo heels dats de good
ole cairo at las i jis knows it 

i says 

 ill take the canoe and go and see jim it mightnt be you know 

he jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottom for
me to set on and give me the paddle and as i shoved off he says 

 pooty soon ill be a shoutn for joy en ill say its all on accounts
o huck is a free man en i couldnt ever ben free ef it hadn ben for
huck huck done it jim wont ever forgit you huck yous de bes fren
jims ever had en yous de only fren ole jims got now 

i was paddling off all in a sweat to tell on him but when he says this 
it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me i went along slow
then and i warnt right down certain whether i was glad i started or
whether i warnt when i was fifty yards off jim says 

 dah you goes de ole true huck de ony white genlman dat ever kep his
promise to ole jim 

well i just felt sick but i says i got to do it i cant get out of
it right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns and
they stopped and i stopped one of them says 

 whats that yonder 

 a piece of a raft i says 

 do you belong on it 

 yes sir 

 any men on it 

 only one sir 

 well theres five niggers run off to night up yonder above the head of
the bend is your man white or black 

i didnt answer up prompt i tried to but the words wouldnt come i
tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it but i warnt man
enough hadnt the spunk of a rabbit i see i was weakening so i just
give up trying and up and says 

 hes white 

 i reckon well go and see for ourselves 

 i wish you would says i because its pap thats there and maybe
youd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is hes sick and so
is mam and mary ann 

 oh the devil were in a hurry boy but i spose weve got to come 
buckle to your paddle and lets get along 

i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars when we had made a
stroke or two i says 

 papll be mighty much obleeged to you i can tell you everybody goes
away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore and i cant do it
by myself 

 well thats infernal mean odd too say boy whats the matter with
your father 

 its the a the well it aint anything much 

they stopped pulling it warnt but a mighty little ways to the raft
now one says 

 boy thats a lie what is the matter with your pap answer up square
now and itll be the better for you 

 i will sir i will honest but dont leave us please its the the
 gentlemen if youll only pull ahead and let me heave you the
headline you wont have to come a near the raft please do 

 set her back john set her back says one they backed water keep
away boy keep to looard confound it i just expect the wind has
blowed it to us your paps got the small pox and you know it precious
well why didnt you come out and say so do you want to spread it all
over 

 well says i a blubbering ive told everybody before and they just
went away and left us 

 poor devil theres something in that we are right down sorry for you 
but we well hang it we dont want the small pox you see look here 
ill tell you what to do dont you try to land by yourself or youll
smash everything to pieces you float along down about twenty miles and
youll come to a town on the left hand side of the river it will be
long after sun up then and when you ask for help you tell them your
folks are all down with chills and fever dont be a fool again and let
people guess what is the matter now were trying to do you a kindness 
so you just put twenty miles between us thats a good boy it wouldnt
do any good to land yonder where the light is its only a wood yard 
say i reckon your fathers poor and im bound to say hes in pretty
hard luck here ill put a twenty dollar gold piece on this board and
you get it when it floats by i feel mighty mean to leave you but my
kingdom it wont do to fool with small pox dont you see

board for me good bye boy you do as mr parker told you and youll
be all right 

 thats so my boy good bye good bye if you see any runaway niggers
you get help and nab them and you can make some money by it 

 good bye sir says i i wont let no runaway niggers get by me if i
can help it 

they went off and i got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because i
knowed very well i had done wrong and i see it warnt no use for me to
try to learn to do right a body that dont get started right when hes
little aint got no show when the pinch comes there aint nothing to
back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat then i
thought a minute and says to myself hold on spose youd a done right
and give jim up would you felt better than what you do now no says i 
id feel bad id feel just the same way i do now well then says i 
whats the use you learning to do right when its troublesome to do right
and aint no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same i was
stuck i couldnt answer that so i reckoned i wouldnt bother no more
about it but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time 

i went into the wigwam jim warnt there i looked all around he warnt
anywhere i says 

 jim 

 here i is huck is dey out o sight yit dont talk loud 

he was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out i told
him they were out of sight so he come aboard he says 

 i was a listenin to all de talk en i slips into de river en was gwyne
to shove for sho if dey come aboard den i was gwyne to swim to de raf
agin when dey was gone but lawsy how you did fool em huck dat wuz
de smartes dodge i tell you chile ispec it save ole jim ole jim
aint going to forgit you for dat honey 

then we talked about the money it was a pretty good raise twenty
dollars apiece jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now 
and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states 
he said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but he wished we
was already there 

towards daybreak we tied up and jim was mighty particular about hiding
the raft good then he worked all day fixing things in bundles and
getting all ready to quit rafting 

that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down
in a left hand bend 

i went off in the canoe to ask about it pretty soon i found a man out
in the river with a skiff setting a trot line i ranged up and says 

 mister is that town cairo 

 cairo no you must be a blame fool 

 what town is it mister 

 if you want to know go and find out if you stay here botherin around
me for about a half a minute longer youll get something you wont want 

i paddled to the raft jim was awful disappointed but i said never
mind cairo would be the next place i reckoned 

we passed another town before daylight and i was going out again but it
was high ground so i didnt go no high ground about cairo jim said 
i had forgot it we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to
the left hand bank i begun to suspicion something so did jim i
says 

 maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night 

he says 

 doan les talk about it huck po niggers cant have no luck i
awluz spected dat rattlesnake skin warnt done wid its work 

 i wish id never seen that snake skin jim i do wish id never laid
eyes on it 

 it aint yo fault huck you didn know dont you blame yoself bout
it 

when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sure enough 
and outside was the old regular muddy so it was all up with cairo 

we talked it all over it wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnt
take the raft up the stream of course there warnt no way but to wait
for dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances so we slept
all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work 
and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone 

we didnt say a word for a good while there warnt anything to say we
both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake skin so
what was the use to talk about it it would only look like we was
finding fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck and keep
on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keep still 

by and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt no
way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a
canoe to go back in we warnt going to borrow it when there warnt
anybody around the way pap would do for that might set people after us 

so we shoved out after dark on the raft 

anybody that dont believe yet that its foolishness to handle a
snake skin after all that that snake skin done for us will believe
it now if they read on and see what more it done for us 

the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore but we
didnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours and
more well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next
meanest thing to fog you cant tell the shape of the river and you
cant see no distance it got to be very late and still and then along
comes a steamboat up the river we lit the lantern and judged she would
see it up stream boats didnt generly come close to us they go out and
follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs but nights like
this they bull right up the channel against the whole river 

we could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till she was
close she aimed right for us often they do that and try to see how
close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites off a
sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinks hes
mighty smart well here she comes and we said she was going to try and
shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit she was a big
one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a black cloud with
rows of glow worms around it but all of a sudden she bulged out big and
scary with a long row of wide open furnace doors shining like red hot
teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us there
was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop the engines a powwow
of cussing and whistling of steam and as jim went overboard on one side
and i on the other she come smashing straight through the raft 

i dived and i aimed to find the bottom too for a thirty foot wheel had
got to go over me and i wanted it to have plenty of room i could
always stay under water a minute this time i reckon i stayed under a
minute and a half then i bounced for the top in a hurry for i was
nearly busting i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of
my nose and puffed a bit of course there was a booming current and of
course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped
them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she was churning
along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though i could
hear her 

i sung out for jim about a dozen times but i didnt get any answer so i
grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water and struck
out for shore shoving it ahead of me but i made out to see that the
drift of the current was towards the left hand shore which meant that i
was in a crossing so i changed off and went that way 

it was one of these long slanting two mile crossings so i was a good
long time in getting over i made a safe landing and clumb up the bank 
i couldnt see but a little ways but i went poking along over rough
ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across a big
old fashioned double log house before i noticed it i was going to rush
by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and
barking at me and i knowed better than to move another peg 




chapter xvii 

in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head
out and says 

 be done boys whos there 

i says 

 its me 

 whos me 

 george jackson sir 

 what do you want

squeeze in d you hear 

i didnt hurry i couldnt if id a wanted to i took one slow step at a
time and there warnt a sound only i thought i could hear my heart the
dogs were as still as the humans but they followed a little behind me 
when i got to the three log doorsteps i heard them unlocking and
unbarring and unbolting i put my hand on the door and pushed it a
little and a little more till somebody said there thats enough put
your head in i done it but i judged they would take it off 

the candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me and
me at them for about a quarter of a minute three big men with guns
pointed at me which made me wince i tell you the oldest gray and
about sixty the other two thirty or more all of them fine and handsome
 and the sweetest old gray headed lady and back of her two young women
which i couldnt see right well the old gentleman says 

 there i reckon its all right come in 

as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it
and bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns and
they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor and
got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows
 there warnt none on the side they held the candle and took a good
look at me and all said why he aint a shepherdson no there aint
any shepherdson about him then the old man said he hoped i wouldnt
mind being searched for arms because he didnt mean no harm by it it
was only to make sure so he didnt pry into my pockets but only felt
outside with his hands and said it was all right he told me to make
myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the old lady
says 

 why bless you saul the poor things as wet as he can be and dont
you reckon it may be hes hungry 

 true for you rachel i forgot 

so the old lady says 

 betsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him something
to eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you girls go and wake
up buck and tell him oh here he is himself buck take this little
stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of
yours thats dry 

buck looked about as old as me thirteen or fourteen or along there 
though he was a little bigger than me he hadnt on anything but a
shirt and he was very frowzy headed he came in gaping and digging one
fist into his eyes and he was dragging a gun along with the other one 
he says 

 aint they no shepherdsons around 

they said no twas a false alarm 

 well he says if theyd a ben some i reckon id a got one 

they all laughed and bob says 

 why buck they might have scalped us all youve been so slow in
coming 

 well nobody come after me and it aint right im always kept down i
dont get no show 

 never mind buck my boy says the old man youll have show enough 
all in good time dont you fret about that go long with you now and
do as your mother told you 

when we got up stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
roundabout and pants of his and i put them on while i was at it he
asked me what my name was but before i could tell him he started to tell
me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day
before yesterday and he asked me where moses was when the candle went
out i said i didnt know i hadnt heard about it before no way 

 well guess he says 

 howm i going to guess says i when i never heard tell of it before 

 but you can guess cant you its just as easy 

 which candle i says

all right come along old hoss 

cold corn pone cold corn beef butter and buttermilk that is what they
had for me down there and there aint nothing better that ever ive come
across yet buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes except the
nigger woman which was gone and the two young women they all smoked
and talked and i eat and talked the young women had quilts around
them and their hair down their backs they all asked me questions and
i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm
down at the bottom of arkansaw and my sister mary ann run off and got
married and never was heard of no more and bill went to hunt them and he
warnt heard of no more and tom and mort died and then there warnt
nobody but just me and pap left and he was just trimmed down to nothing 
on account of his troubles so when he died i took what there was left 
because the farm didnt belong to us and started up the river deck
passage and fell overboard and that was how i come to be here so they
said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it then it was most
daylight and everybody went to bed and i went to bed with buck and when
i waked up in the morning drat it all i had forgot what my name was 
so i laid there about an hour trying to think and when buck waked up i
says 

 can you spell buck 

 yes he says 

 i bet you cant spell my name says i 

 i bet you what you dare i can says he 

 all right says i go ahead 

 g e o r g e j a x o n there now he says 

 well says i you done it but i didnt think you could it aint no
slouch of a name to spell right off without studying 

i set it down private because somebody might want me to spell it next 
and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to
it 

it was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too i hadnt seen
no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
style it didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one
with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses in
town there warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heaps
of parlors in towns has beds in them there was a big fireplace that was
bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring
water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimes they wash
them over with red water paint that they call spanish brown same as they
do in town they had big brass dog irons that could hold up a saw log 
there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece with a picture of a
town painted on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in
the middle of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swinging
behind it it was beautiful to hear that clock tick and sometimes when
one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in
good shape she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she
got tuckered out they wouldnt took any money for her 

well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made
out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy by one of the parrots
was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the other and when you
pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt open their mouths nor look
different nor interested they squeaked through underneath there was a
couple of big wild turkey wing fans spread out behind those things on
the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery
basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it 
which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is but
they warnt real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off
and showed the white chalk or whatever it was underneath 

this table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red and
blue spread eagle painted on it and a painted border all around it
come all the way from philadelphia they said there was some books 
too piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table one was a
big family bible full of pictures one was pilgrims progress about a
man that left his family it didnt say why i read considerable in it
now and then the statements was interesting but tough another was
friendships offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but i didnt
read the poetry another was henry clays speeches and another was dr 
gunns family medicine which told you all about what to do if a body was
sick or dead there was a hymn book and a lot of other books and
there was nice split bottom chairs and perfectly sound too not bagged
down in the middle and busted like an old basket 

they had pictures hung on the walls mainly washingtons and lafayettes 
and battles and highland marys and one called signing the
declaration there was some that they called crayons which one of the
daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen
years old they was different from any pictures i ever see before
 blacker mostly than is common one was a woman in a slim black dress 
belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage in the middle
of the sleeves and a large black scoop shovel bonnet with a black veil 
and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape and very wee black
slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on
her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other hand hanging down
her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule and underneath the
picture it said shall i never see thee more alas another one was a
young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head 
and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair back and she was
crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her
other hand with its heels up and underneath the picture it said i shall
never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas there was one where a young
lady was at a window looking up at the moon and tears running down her
cheeks and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax
showing on one edge of it and she was mashing a locket with a chain to
it against her mouth and underneath the picture it said and art thou
gone yes thou art gone alas these was all nice pictures i reckon but
i didnt somehow seem to take to them because if ever i was down a
little they always give me the fan tods everybody was sorry she died 
because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do and a body
could see by what she had done what they had lost but i reckoned that
with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard she
was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took
sick and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to
live till she got it done but she never got the chance it was a
picture of a young woman in a long white gown standing on the rail of a
bridge all ready to jump off with her hair all down her back and
looking up to the moon with the tears running down her face and she had
two arms folded across her breast and two arms stretched out in front 
and two more reaching up towards the moon and the idea was to see which
pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arms but as i
was saying she died before she got her mind made up and now they kept
this picture over the head of the bed in her room and every time her
birthday come they hung flowers on it other times it was hid with a
little curtain the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice
sweet face but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery 
seemed to me 

this young girl kept a scrap book when she was alive and used to paste
obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
presbyterian observer and write poetry after them out of her own head 
it was very good poetry this is what she wrote about a boy by the name
of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded 


 ode to stephen dowling bots decd

 and did young stephen sicken 
 and did young stephen die 
 and did the sad hearts thicken 
 and did the mourners cry 

 no such was not the fate of
 young stephen dowling bots 
 though sad hearts round him thickened 
 twas not from sickness shots 

 no whooping cough did rack his frame 
 nor measles drear with spots 
 not these impaired the sacred name
 of stephen dowling bots 

 despised love struck not with woe
 that head of curly knots 
 nor stomach troubles laid him low 
 young stephen dowling bots 

 o no then list with tearful eye 
 whilst i his fate do tell 
 his soul did from this cold world fly
 by falling down a well 

 they got him out and emptied him 
 alas it was too late 
 his spirit was gone for to sport aloft
 in the realms of the good and great 

if emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
fourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by buck
said she could rattle off poetry like nothing she didnt ever have to
stop to think he said she would slap down a line and if she couldnt
find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down
another one and go ahead she warnt particular she could write about
anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful 
every time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be on
hand with her tribute before he was cold she called them tributes 
the neighbors said it was the doctor first then emmeline then the
undertaker the undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once and
then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead persons name which was
whistler she warnt ever the same after that she never complained but
she kinder pined away and did not live long poor thing manys the time
i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out
her poor old scrap book and read in it when her pictures had been
aggravating me and i had soured on her a little i liked all that
family dead ones and all and warnt going to let anything come between
us poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was
alive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make some
about her now she was gone so i tried to sweat out a verse or two
myself but i couldnt seem to make it go somehow they kept emmelines
room trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked
to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there the old
lady took care of the room herself though there was plenty of niggers 
and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly 

well as i was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains on
the windows white with pictures painted on them of castles with vines
all down the walls and cattle coming down to drink there was a little
old piano too that had tin pans in it i reckon and nothing was ever
so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and
play the battle of prague on it the walls of all the rooms was
plastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house was
whitewashed on the outside 

it was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and
floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day 
and it was a cool comfortable place nothing couldnt be better and
warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it too 




chapter xviii 

col grangerford was a gentleman you see he was a gentleman all over 
and so was his family he was well born as the saying is and thats
worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the widow douglas said 
and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town 
and pap he always said it too though he warnt no more quality than a
mudcat himself col grangerford was very tall and very slim and had a
darkish paly complexion not a sign of red in it anywheres he was clean
shaved every morning all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind
of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils and a high nose and heavy
eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk so deep back that they
seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you as you may say his
forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his
shoulders his hands was long and thin and every day of his life he put
on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so
white it hurt your eyes to look at it and on sundays he wore a blue
tail coat with brass buttons on it he carried a mahogany cane with a
silver head to it there warnt no frivolishness about him not a bit 
and he warnt ever loud he was as kind as he could be you could feel
that you know and so you had confidence sometimes he smiled and it
was good to see but when he straightened himself up like a liberty pole 
and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you
wanted to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was
afterwards he didnt ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners
 everybody was always good mannered where he was everybody loved to have
him around too he was sunshine most always i mean he made it seem
like good weather when he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for
half a minute and that was enough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again
for a week 

when him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up
out of their chairs and give them good day and didnt set down again
till they had set down then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the
decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him and he
held it in his hand and waited till toms and bobs was mixed and then
they bowed and said our duty to you sir and madam and they bowed
the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all
three and bob and tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the
mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers and give
it to me and buck and we drank to the old people too 

bob was the oldest and tom next tall beautiful men with very broad
shoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes they
dressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and
wore broad panama hats 

then there was miss charlotte she was twenty five and tall and proud
and grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up but
when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks like
her father she was beautiful 

so was her sister miss sophia but it was a different kind she was
gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twenty 

each person had their own nigger to wait on them buck too my nigger
had a monstrous easy time because i warnt used to having anybody do
anything for me but bucks was on the jump most of the time 

this was all there was of the family now but there used to be more
 three sons they got killed and emmeline that died 

the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers 
sometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten or
fifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketings
round about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woods
daytimes and balls at the house nights these people was mostly
kinfolks of the family the men brought their guns with them it was a
handsome lot of quality i tell you 

there was another clan of aristocracy around there five or six families
 mostly of the name of shepherdson they was as high toned and well
born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords the shepherdsons
and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which was about two
mile above our house so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our
folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on their fine horses 

one day buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horse
coming we was crossing the road buck says 

 quick jump for the woods 

we done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves pretty
soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting his horse
easy and looking like a soldier he had his gun across his pommel i
had seen him before it was young harney shepherdson i heard bucks
gun go off at my ear and harneys hat tumbled off from his head he
grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid but we
didnt wait we started through the woods on a run the woods warnt
thick so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet and twice i seen
harney cover buck with his gun and then he rode away the way he come to
get his hat i reckon but i couldnt see we never stopped running till
we got home the old gentlemans eyes blazed a minute twas pleasure 
mainly i judged then his face sort of smoothed down and he says 
kind of gentle 

 i dont like that shooting from behind a bush why didnt you step into
the road my boy 

 the shepherdsons dont father they always take advantage 

miss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck was telling
his tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped the two young
men looked dark but never said nothing miss sophia she turned pale 
but the color come back when she found the man warnt hurt 

soon as i could get buck down by the corn cribs under the trees by
ourselves i says 

 did you want to kill him buck 

 well i bet i did 

 what did he do to you 

 him he never done nothing to me 

 well then what did you want to kill him for 

 why nothing only its on account of the feud 

 whats a feud 

 why where was you raised dont you know what a feud is 

 never heard of it before tell me about it 

 well says buck a feud is this way a man has a quarrel with another
man and kills him then that other mans brother kills him then the
other brothers on both sides goes for one another then the cousins
chip in and by and by everybodys killed off and there aint no more
feud but its kind of slow and takes a long time 

 has this one been going on long buck 

 well i should reckon it started thirty year ago or somers along
there there was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settle
it and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot the man
that won the suit which he would naturally do of course anybody
would 

 what was the trouble about buck land 

 i reckon maybe i dont know 

 well who done the shooting was it a grangerford or a shepherdson 

 laws how do i know it was so long ago 

 dont anybody know 

 oh yes pa knows i reckon and some of the other old people but they
dont know now what the row was about in the first place 

 has there been many killed buck 

 yes right smart chance of funerals but they dont always kill pas
got a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weigh much 
anyway bobs been carved up some with a bowie and toms been hurt once
or twice 

 has anybody been killed this year buck 

 yes we got one and they got one bout three months ago my cousin bud 
fourteen year old was riding through the woods on tother side of the
river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blame foolishness 
and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a coming behind him and sees
old baldy shepherdson a linkin after him with his gun in his hand and
his white hair a flying in the wind and stead of jumping off and taking
to the brush bud lowed he could out run him so they had it nip and
tuck for five mile or more the old man a gaining all the time so at
last bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and faced around so as to
have the bullet holes in front you know and the old man he rode up and
shot him down but he didnt git much chance to enjoy his luck for
inside of a week our folks laid him out 

 i reckon that old man was a coward buck 

 i reckon he warnt a coward not by a blame sight there aint a
coward amongst them shepherdsons not a one and there aint no cowards
amongst the grangerfords either why that old man kep up his end in a
fight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords and come out
winner they was all a horseback he lit off of his horse and got behind
a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop the bullets but
the grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man 
and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them him and his
horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but the grangerfords had
to be fetched home and one of em was dead and another died the next
day no sir if a bodys out hunting for cowards he dont want to fool
away any time amongst them shepherdsons becuz they dont breed any of
that kind 

next sunday we all went to church about three mile everybody
a horseback the men took their guns along so did buck and kept them
between their knees or stood them handy against the wall the
shepherdsons done the same it was pretty ornery preaching all about
brotherly love and such like tiresomeness but everybody said it was a
good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had such a
powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
preforeordestination and i dont know what all that it did seem to me
to be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yet 

about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in their
chairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull buck and a
dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep i went up to
our room and judged i would take a nap myself i found that sweet miss
sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she took me in
her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if i liked her and i
said i did and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell
anybody and i said i would then she said shed forgot her testament 
and left it in the seat at church between two other books and would i
slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say nothing to
nobody i said i would so i slid out and slipped off up the road and
there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or two for there
warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floor in
summer time because its cool if you notice most folks dont go
to church only when theyve got to but a hog is different 

says i to myself somethings up it aint natural for a girl to be in
such a sweat about a testament so i give it a shake and out drops a
little piece of paper with half past two wrote on it with a pencil i
ransacked it but couldnt find anything else i couldnt make anything
out of that so i put the paper in the book again and when i got home
and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me she
pulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the testament till she
found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad and before a
body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze and said i was the
best boy in the world and not to tell anybody she was mighty red in
the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and it made her powerful
pretty i was a good deal astonished but when i got my breath i asked
her what the paper was about and she asked me if i had read it and i
said no and she asked me if i could read writing and i told her no 
only coarse hand and then she said the paper warnt anything but a
book mark to keep her place and i might go and play now 

i went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soon i
noticed that my nigger was following along behind when we was out of
sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comes
a running and says 

 mars jawge if youll come down into de swamp ill show you a whole
stack o water moccasins 

thinks i thats mighty curious he said that yesterday he oughter know
a body dont love water moccasins enough to go around hunting for them 
what is he up to anyway so i says 

 all right trot ahead 

i followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and waded
ankle deep as much as another half mile we come to a little flat piece
of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines and
he says 

 you shove right in dah jist a few steps mars jawge dahs whah dey is 
is seed m befo i dont kyer to see em no mo 

then he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the trees hid
him i poked into the place a ways and come to a little open patch as
big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man laying there
asleep and by jings it was my old jim 

i waked him up and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him
to see me again but it warnt he nearly cried he was so glad but he
warnt surprised said he swum along behind me that night and heard me
yell every time but dasnt answer because he didnt want nobody to pick
him up and take him into slavery again says he

he loaded up his gun en lowed hes gwyne to fetch home a shepherdson or
bust well deyll be plenty un m dah i reckn en you bet you hell
fetch one ef he gits a chanst 

i took up the river road as hard as i could put by and by i begin to
hear guns a good ways off when i come in sight of the log store and the
woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the trees and
brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into the forks of a
cottonwood that was out of reach and watched there was a wood rank
four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first i was going
to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier i didnt 

there was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
place before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get at a
couple of young chaps that was behind the wood rank alongside of the
steamboat landing but they couldnt come it every time one of them
showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at the two
boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watch both
ways 

by and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling they started
riding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steady
bead over the wood rank and drops one of them out of his saddle all
the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
to carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on the
run they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticed 
then the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out after
them they gained on the boys but it didnt do no good the boys had
too good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree 
and slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men again 
one of the boys was buck and the other was a slim young chap about
nineteen years old 

the men ripped around awhile and then rode away as soon as they was
out of sight i sung out to buck and told him he didnt know what to
make of my voice coming out of the tree at first he was awful
surprised he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men
come in sight again said they was up to some devilment or other
 wouldnt be gone long i wished i was out of that tree but i dasnt
come down buck begun to cry and rip and lowed that him and his cousin
joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet he
said his father and his two brothers was killed and two or three of the
enemy said the shepherdsons laid for them in ambush buck said his
father and brothers ought to waited for their relations the shepherdsons
was too strong for them i asked him what was become of young harney and
miss sophia he said theyd got across the river and was safe i was
glad of that but the way buck did take on because he didnt manage to
kill harney that day he shot at him i haint ever heard anything like
it 

all of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four guns the men had
slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
horses the boys jumped for the river both of them hurt and as they
swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and
singing out kill them kill them it made me so sick i most fell out
of the tree i aint a going to tell all that happened it would make me
sick again if i was to do that i wished i hadnt ever come ashore that
night to see such things i aint ever going to get shut of them lots
of times i dream about them 

i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down 
sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods and twice i seen little
gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so i reckoned the
trouble was still a going on i was mighty downhearted so i made up my
mind i wouldnt ever go anear that house again because i reckoned i was
to blame somehow i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss
sophia was to meet harney somewheres at half past two and run off and i
judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
she acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess
wouldnt ever happened 

when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a
piece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water and
tugged at them till i got them ashore then i covered up their faces and
got away as quick as i could i cried a little when i was covering up
bucks face for he was mighty good to me 

it was just dark now i never went near the house but struck through
the woods and made for the swamp jim warnt on his island so i tramped
off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willows red hot to
jump aboard and get out of that awful country the raft was gone my
souls but i was scared i couldnt get my breath for most a minute 
then i raised a yell a voice not twenty five foot from me says 

 good lan is dat you honey doan make no noise 

it was jims voice nothing ever sounded so good before i run along the
bank a piece and got aboard and jim he grabbed me and hugged me he was
so glad to see me he says 

 laws bless you chile i uz right down sho yous dead agin jacks
been heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home no
mo so is jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf er de
crick sos to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as jack comes
agin en tells me for certain you is dead lawsy is mighty glad to git
you back again honey 

i says 

 all right thats mighty good they wont find me and theyll think
ive been killed and floated down the river theres something up there
that ll help them think so so dont you lose no time jim but just
shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can 

i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the
middle of the mississippi then we hung up our signal lantern and
judged that we was free and safe once more i hadnt had a bite to eat
since yesterday so jim he got out some corn dodgers and buttermilk and
pork and cabbage and greens there aint nothing in the world so good
when its cooked right and whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a
good time i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so was
jim to get away from the swamp we said there warnt no home like a
raft after all other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but a
raft dont you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft 




chapter xix 

two or three days and nights went by i reckon i might say they swum by 
they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely here is the way we put
in the time it was a monstrous big river down there sometimes a mile
and a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon as
night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up nearly always in
the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods and
willows and hid the raft with them then we set out the lines next we
slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off 
then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep 
and watched the daylight come not a sound anywheres perfectly still
 just like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogs
a cluttering maybe the first thing to see looking away over the water 
was a kind of dull line that was the woods on tother side you couldnt
make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then more paleness
spreading around then the river softened up away off and warnt black
any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever
so far away trading scows and such things and long black streaks
 rafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking or jumbled up voices 
it was so still and sounds come so far and by and by you could see a
streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that theres
a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak
look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the
east reddens up and the river and you make out a log cabin in the edge
of the woods away on the bank on tother side of the river being a
woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through
it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up and comes fanning you from
over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods
and the flowers but sometimes not that way because theyve left dead
fish laying around gars and such and they do get pretty rank and next
youve got the full day and everything smiling in the sun and the
song birds just going it 

a little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish off of
the lines and cook up a hot breakfast and afterwards we would watch the
lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and by lazy off
to sleep wake up by and by and look to see what done it and maybe see
a steamboat coughing along up stream so far off towards the other side
you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern wheel or
side wheel then for about an hour there wouldnt be nothing to hear nor
nothing to see just solid lonesomeness next youd see a raft sliding
by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on it chopping because theyre
most always doing it on a raft youd see the axe flash and come down
 you dont hear nothing you see that axe go up again and by the time
its above the mans head then you hear the kchunk it had took all
that time to come over the water so we would put in the day lazying
around listening to the stillness once there was a thick fog and the
rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats
wouldnt run over them a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear
them talking and cussing and laughing heard them plain but we couldnt
see no sign of them it made you feel crawly it was like spirits
carrying on that way in the air jim said he believed it was spirits 
but i says 

 no spirits wouldnt say dern the dern fog 

soon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about the
middle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wanted
her to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water and
talked about all kinds of things we was always naked day and night 
whenever the mosquitoes would let us the new clothes bucks folks made
for me was too good to be comfortable and besides i didnt go much on
clothes nohow 

sometimes wed have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
time yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybe a
spark which was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the water
you could see a spark or two on a raft or a scow you know and maybe
you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts 
its lovely to live on a raft we had the sky up there all speckled
with stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them and
discuss about whether they was made or only just happened jim he
allowed they was made but i allowed they happened i judged it would
have took too long to make so many jim said the moon could a laid them 
well that looked kind of reasonable so i didnt say nothing against it 
because ive seen a frog lay most as many so of course it could be done 
we used to watch the stars that fell too and see them streak down jim
allowed theyd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest 

once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of
her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awful
pretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and
her powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by her
waves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle the
raft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnt
tell how long except maybe frogs or something 

after midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two or three
hours the shores was black no more sparks in the cabin windows these
sparks was our clock the first one that showed again meant morning was
coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away 

one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to
the main shore it was only two hundred yards and paddled about a mile
up a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if i couldnt get some
berries just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
the crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as
they could foot it i thought i was a goner for whenever anybody was
after anybody i judged it was me or maybe jim i was about to dig out
from there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sung out
and begged me to save their lives said they hadnt been doing nothing 
and was being chased for it said there was men and dogs a coming they
wanted to jump right in but i says 

 dont you do it i dont hear the dogs and horses yet youve got time
to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then you
take to the water and wade down to me and get in thatll throw the dogs
off the scent 

they done it and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead and
in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off 
shouting we heard them come along towards the crick but couldnt see
them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got
further and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them at
all by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the
river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid
in the cottonwoods and was safe 

one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald head
and very gray whiskers he had an old battered up slouch hat on and a
greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed
into his boot tops and home knit galluses no he only had one he had
an old long tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
his arm and both of them had big fat ratty looking carpet bags 

the other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery after
breakfast we all laid off and talked and the first thing that come out
was that these chaps didnt know one another 

 what got you into trouble says the baldhead to tother chap 

 well id been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth and
it does take it off too and generly the enamel along with it but i
stayed about one night longer than i ought to and was just in the act of
sliding out when i ran across you on the trail this side of town and you
told me they were coming and begged me to help you to get off so i
told you i was expecting trouble myself and would scatter out with you 
thats the whole yarn whats yourn 

 well id ben a running a little temperance revival thar bout a week 
and was the pet of the women folks big and little for i was makin it
mighty warm for the rummies i tell you and takin as much as five or
six dollars a night ten cents a head children and niggers free and

private jug on the sly a nigger rousted me out this mornin and told
me the people was getherin on the quiet with their dogs and horses and
theyd be along pretty soon and give me bout half an hours start and
then run me down if they could and if they got me theyd tar and feather
me and ride me on a rail sure i didnt wait for no breakfast i warnt
hungry

nobody never said anything for a while then the young man hove a sigh
and says 

 alas 

 what re you alassin about says the bald head 

 to think i should have lived to be leading such a life and be degraded
down into such company and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with
a rag 

 dern your skin aint the company good enough for you says the
baldhead pretty pert and uppish 

 yes it is good enough for me its as good as i deserve for who
fetched me so low when i was so high i did myself i dont blame you 
gentlemen far from it i dont blame anybody i deserve it all let
the cold world do its worst one thing i know theres a grave somewhere

from me loved ones property everything but it cant take that 
some day ill lie down in it and forget it all and my poor broken heart

 ah you would not believe me the world never believes let it pass
 tis no matter the secret of my birth 

 the secret of your birth do you mean to say 

 gentlemen says the young man very solemn i will reveal it to you 
for i feel i may have confidence in you by rights i am a duke 

jims eyes bugged out when he heard that and i reckon mine did too 
then the baldhead says no you cant mean it 

 yes my great grandfather eldest son of the duke of bridgewater fled
to this country about the end of the last century to breathe the pure
air of freedom married here and died leaving a son his own father
dying about the same time the second son of the late duke seized the
titles and estates the infant real duke was ignored i am the lineal
descendant of that infant i am the rightful duke of bridgewater and
here am i forlorn torn from my high estate hunted of men despised by
the cold world ragged worn heart broken and degraded to the
companionship of felons on a raft 

jim pitied him ever so much and so did i we tried to comfort him but
he said it warnt much use he couldnt be much comforted said if we was
a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than most anything
else so we said we would if he would tell us how he said we ought to
bow when we spoke to him and say your grace or my lord or your
lordship and he wouldnt mind it if we called him plain
 bridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name and
one of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing for him
he wanted done 

well that was all easy so we done it all through dinner jim stood
around and waited on him and says will yo grace have some o dis or
some o dat and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to
him 

but the old man got pretty silent by and by didnt have much to say and
didnt look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
around that duke he seemed to have something on his mind so along in
the afternoon he says 

 looky here bilgewater he says im nation sorry for you but you
aint the only person thats had troubles like that 

 no 

 no you aint you aint the only person thats ben snaked down
wrongfully outn a high place 

 alas 

 no you aint the only person thats had a secret of his birth and 
by jings he begins to cry 

 hold what do you mean 

 bilgewater kin i trust you says the old man still sort of sobbing 

 to the bitter death he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it 
and says that secret of your being speak 

 bilgewater i am the late dauphin 

you bet you jim and me stared this time then the duke says 

 you are what 

 yes my friend it is too true your eyes is lookin at this very moment
on the pore disappeared dauphin looy the seventeen son of looy the
sixteen and marry antonette 

 you at your age no you mean youre the late charlemagne you must
be six or seven hundred years old at the very least 

 trouble has done it bilgewater trouble has done it trouble has brung
these gray hairs and this premature balditude yes gentlemen you see
before you in blue jeans and misery the wanderin exiled trampled on 
and sufferin rightful king of france 

well he cried and took on so that me and jim didnt know hardly what to
do we was so sorry and so glad and proud wed got him with us too so
we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comfort him 
but he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and done with it all
could do him any good though he said it often made him feel easier and
better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and got
down on one knee to speak to him and always called him your majesty 
and waited on him first at meals and didnt set down in his presence
till he asked them so jim and me set to majestying him and doing this
and that and tother for him and standing up till he told us we might
set down this done him heaps of good and so he got cheerful and
comfortable but the duke kind of soured on him and didnt look a bit
satisfied with the way things was going still the king acted real
friendly towards him and said the dukes great grandfather and all the
other dukes of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father and
was allowed to come to the palace considerable but the duke stayed huffy
a good while till by and by the king says 

 like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h yer raft 
bilgewater and so whats the use o your bein sour it ll only make
things oncomfortable it aint my fault i warnt born a duke it aint
your fault you warnt born a king so whats the use to worry make the
best o things the way you find em says i thats my motto this aint
no bad thing that weve struck here plenty grub and an easy life come 
give us your hand duke and les all be friends 

the duke done it and jim and me was pretty glad to see it it took away
all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it because it
would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft 
for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybody to be
satisfied and feel right and kind towards the others 

it didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnt no
kings nor dukes at all but just low down humbugs and frauds but i
never said nothing never let on kept it to myself its the best way 
then you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble if they
wanted us to call them kings and dukes i hadnt no objections long as
it would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell jim so i
didnt tell him if i never learnt nothing else out of pap i learnt
that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
have their own way 




chapter xx 

they asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what we covered
up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead of running
 was jim a runaway nigger says i 

 goodness sakes would a runaway nigger run south 

no they allowed he wouldnt i had to account for things some way so i
says 

 my folks was living in pike county in missouri where i was born and
they all died off but me and pa and my brother ike pa he lowed hed
break up and go down and live with uncle ben whos got a little
one horse place on the river forty four mile below orleans pa was
pretty poor and had some debts so when hed squared up there warnt
nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger jim that warnt enough
to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way well 
when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketched this
piece of a raft so we reckoned wed go down to orleans on it pas luck
didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one
night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel jim and me
come up all right but pa was drunk and ike was only four years old so
they never come up no more well for the next day or two we had
considerable trouble because people was always coming out in skiffs and
trying to take jim away from me saying they believed he was a runaway
nigger we dont run daytimes no more now nights they dont bother us 

the duke says 

 leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
want to ill think the thing over ill invent a plan thatll fix it 
well let it alone for to day because of course we dont want to go by
that town yonder in daylight it mightnt be healthy 

towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heat
lightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves was
beginning to shiver it was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to see
that so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to see
what the beds was like my bed was a straw tick better than jims which
was a corn shuck tick theres always cobs around about in a shuck tick 
and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dry shucks
sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves it makes such a
rustling that you wake up well the duke allowed he would take my bed 
but the king allowed he wouldnt he says 

 i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
a corn shuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on your grace ll
take the shuck bed yourself 

jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there was
going to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad when
the duke says 

 tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
oppression misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit i yield i
submit tis my fate i am alone in the world let me suffer can bear
it 

we got away as soon as it was good and dark the king told us to stand
well out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till we
got a long ways below the town we come in sight of the little bunch of
lights by and by that was the town you know and slid by about a half
a mile out all right when we was three quarters of a mile below we
hoisted up our signal lantern and about ten oclock it come on to rain
and blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told us to
both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke
crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night it was my watch
below till twelve but i wouldnt a turned in anyway if id had a bed 
because a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week not
by a long sight my souls how the wind did scream along and every
second or two thered come a glare that lit up the white caps for a half
a mile around and youd see the islands looking dusty through the rain 
and the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a h whack bum 
bum bumble umble um bum bum bum bum and the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away and quit and then rip comes another flash and
another sockdolager the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes 
but i hadnt any clothes on and didnt mind we didnt have no trouble
about snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
that and miss them 

i had the middle watch you know but i was pretty sleepy by that time 
so jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was always
mighty good that way jim was i crawled into the wigwam but the king
and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnt no show for
me so i laid outside i didnt mind the rain because it was warm and
the waves warnt running so high now about two they come up again 
though and jim was going to call me but he changed his mind because he
reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he was mistaken
about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper
and washed me overboard it most killed jim a laughing he was the
easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway 

i took the watch and jim he laid down and snored away and by and by the
storm let up for good and all and the first cabin light that showed i
rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day 

the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and him and
the duke played seven up a while five cents a game then they got tired
of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they called it 
the duke went down into his carpet bag and fetched up a lot of little
printed bills and read them out loud one bill said the celebrated dr 
armand de montalban of paris would lecture on the science of
phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day of blank at ten
cents admission and furnish charts of character at twenty five cents
apiece the duke said that was him in another bill he was the
 world renowned shakespearian tragedian garrick the younger of drury
lane london in other bills he had a lot of other names and done other
wonderful things like finding water and gold with a divining rod 
 dissipating witch spells and so on by and by he says 

 but the histrionic muse is the darling have you ever trod the boards 
royalty 

 no says the king 

 you shall then before youre three days older fallen grandeur says
the duke the first good town we come to well hire a hall and do the
sword fight in richard iii and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet 
how does that strike you 

 im in up to the hub for anything that will pay bilgewater but you
see i dont know nothing about play actin and haint ever seen much of
it i was too small when pap used to have em at the palace do you
reckon you can learn me 

 easy 

 all right im jist a freezn for something fresh anyway les
commence right away 

so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was and
said he was used to being romeo so the king could be juliet 

 but if juliets such a young gal duke my peeled head and my white
whiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybe 

 no dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of that 
besides you know youll be in costume and that makes all the
difference in the world juliets in a balcony enjoying the moonlight
before she goes to bed and shes got on her night gown and her ruffled
nightcap here are the costumes for the parts 

he got out two or three curtain calico suits which he said was meedyevil
armor for richard iii and tother chap and a long white cotton
nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match the king was satisfied so
the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid
spread eagle way prancing around and acting at the same time to show
how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him
to get his part by heart 

there was a little one horse town about three mile down the bend and
after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
in daylight without it being dangersome for jim so he allowed he would
go down to the town and fix that thing the king allowed he would go 
too and see if he couldnt strike something we was out of coffee so
jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some 

when we got there there warnt nobody stirring streets empty and
perfectly dead and still like sunday we found a sick nigger sunning
himself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young or
too sick or too old was gone to camp meeting about two mile back in the
woods the king got the directions and allowed hed go and work that
camp meeting for all it was worth and i might go too 

the duke said what he was after was a printing office we found it a
little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shop carpenters and
printers all gone to the meeting and no doors locked it was a dirty 
littered up place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures of
horses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls the duke shed
his coat and said he was all right now so me and the king lit out for
the camp meeting 

we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a most
awful hot day there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty
mile around the woods was full of teams and wagons hitched
everywheres feeding out of the wagon troughs and stomping to keep off
the flies there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
branches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles of
watermelons and green corn and such like truck 

the preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they was
bigger and held crowds of people the benches was made out of outside
slabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into
for legs they didnt have no backs the preachers had high platforms to
stand on at one end of the sheds the women had on sun bonnets and some
had linsey woolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of the young ones
had on calico some of the young men was barefooted and some of the
children didnt have on any clothes but just a tow linen shirt some of
the old women was knitting and some of the young folks was courting on
the sly 

the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn he lined
out two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it 
there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way then he
lined out two more for them to sing and so on the people woke up more
and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end some begun to
groan and some begun to shout then the preacher begun to preach and
begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side of the platform
and then the other and then a leaning down over the front of it with
his arms and his body going all the time and shouting his words out with
all his might and every now and then he would hold up his bible and
spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shouting 
 its the brazen serpent in the wilderness look upon it and live and
people would shout out glory a a men and so he went on and the
people groaning and crying and saying amen 

 oh come to the mourners bench come black with sin amen come 
sick and sore amen come lame and halt and blind amen come pore
and needy sunk in shame a a men come all thats worn and soiled and
suffering come with a broken spirit come with a contrite heart come
in your rags and sin and dirt the waters that cleanse is free the door
of heaven stands open oh enter in and be at rest a a men glory 
glory hallelujah 

and so on you couldnt make out what the preacher said any more on
account of the shouting and crying folks got up everywheres in the
crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners bench 
with the tears running down their faces and when all the mourners had
got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and
flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild 

well the first i knowed the king got a going and you could hear him
over everybody and next he went a charging up on to the platform and
the preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it he
told them he was a pirate been a pirate for thirty years out in the
indian ocean and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in
a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks to
goodness hed been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat
without a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing that
ever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy for the
first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to start right
off and work his way back to the indian ocean and put in the rest of his
life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he could do it
better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crews in that
ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without
money he would get there anyway and every time he convinced a pirate he
would say to him dont you thank me dont you give me no credit it
all belongs to them dear people in pokeville camp meeting natural
brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacher there the
truest friend a pirate ever had 

and then he busted into tears and so did everybody then somebody sings
out take up a collection for him take up a collection well a half
a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out let him pass the
hat around then everybody said it the preacher too 

so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes 
and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so
good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while the
prettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks would
up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and he
always done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or
six times and he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him to
live in their houses and said theyd think it was an honor but he said
as this was the last day of the camp meeting he couldnt do no good and
besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to
work on the pirates 

when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
collected eighty seven dollars and seventy five cents and then he had
fetched away a three gallon jug of whisky too that he found under a
wagon when he was starting home through the woods the king said take
it all around it laid over any day hed ever put in in the missionarying
line he said it warnt no use talking heathens dont amount to shucks
alongside of pirates to work a camp meeting with 

the duke was thinking hed been doing pretty well till the king come to
show up but after that he didnt think so so much he had set up and
printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing office horse
bills and took the money four dollars and he had got in ten
dollars worth of advertisements for the paper which he said he would
put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance so they done it 
the price of the paper was two dollars a year but he took in three
subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in
advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual but he
said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as
he could afford it and was going to run it for cash he set up a little
piece of poetry which he made himself out of his own head three
verses kind of sweet and saddish the name of it was yes crush cold
world this breaking heart and he left that all set up and ready to
print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it well he took in
nine dollars and a half and said hed done a pretty square days work
for it 

then he showed us another little job hed printed and hadnt charged for 
because it was for us it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a
bundle on a stick over his shoulder and reward under it the
reading was all about jim and just described him to a dot it said he
run away from st jacques plantation forty mile below new orleans last
winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and send him
back he could have the reward and expenses 

 now says the duke after to night we can run in the daytime if we
want to whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and foot
with a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
captured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboat so
we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to
get the reward handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim but
it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor too much like
jewelry ropes are the correct thing we must preserve the unities as
we say on the boards 

we all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no trouble
about running daytimes we judged we could make miles enough that night
to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukes work in the
printing office was going to make in that little town then we could boom
right along if we wanted to 

we laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly ten oclock 
then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnt hoist our
lantern till we was clear out of sight of it 

when jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he says 

 huck does you reckn we gwyne to run acrost any mo kings on dis trip 

 no i says i reckon not 

 well says he dats all right den i doan mine one er two kings 
but dats enough dis ones powerful drunk en de duke ain much
better 

i found jim had been trying to get him to talk french so he could hear
what it was like but he said he had been in this country so long and
had so much trouble hed forgot it 




chapter xxi 

it was after sun up now but we went right on and didnt tie up the
king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but after
theyd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal 
after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and
pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legs dangle
in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and went to
getting his romeo and juliet by heart when he had got it pretty good
him and the duke begun to practice it together the duke had to learn
him over and over again how to say every speech and he made him sigh 
and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it
pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out romeo that way 
like a bull you must say it soft and sick and languishy so r o o meo 
that is the idea for juliets a dear sweet mere child of a girl you
know and she doesnt bray like a jackass 

well next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of
oak laths and begun to practice the sword fight the duke called himself
richard iii and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was
grand to see but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard and
after that they took a rest and had a talk about all kinds of adventures
theyd had in other times along the river 

after dinner the duke says 

 well capet well want to make this a first class show you know so i
guess well add a little more to it we want a little something to
answer encores with anyway 

 whats onkores bilgewater 

the duke told him and then says 

 ill answer by doing the highland fling or the sailors hornpipe and
you well let me see oh ive got it you can do hamlets soliloquy 

 hamlets which 

 hamlets soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in shakespeare 
ah its sublime sublime always fetches the house i havent got it
in the book ive only got one volume but i reckon i can piece it out
from memory ill just walk up and down a minute and see if i can call
it back from recollections vaults 

so he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horrible every
now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he would squeeze
his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan next he would
sigh and next hed let on to drop a tear it was beautiful to see him 
by and by he got it he told us to give attention then he strikes a
most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and his arms stretched
away up and his head tilted back looking up at the sky and then he
begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after that all through
his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up his chest and
just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before this is the
speech i learned it easy enough while he was learning it to the king 

to be or not to be that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity of so
long life for who would fardels bear till birnam wood do come to
dunsinane but that the fear of something after death murders the
innocent sleep great natures second course and makes us rather sling
the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of 
theres the respect must give us pause wake duncan with thy knocking i
would thou couldst for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the
oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the laws delay and the
quietus which his pangs might take in the dead waste and middle of the
night when churchyards yawn in customary suits of solemn black but that
the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns breathes
forth contagion on the world and thus the native hue of resolution like
the poor cat i the adage is sicklied oer with care and all the clouds
that lowered oer our housetops with this regard their currents turn
awry and lose the name of action tis a consummation devoutly to be
wished but soft you the fair ophelia ope not thy ponderous and marble
jaws but get thee to a nunnery go 

well the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so he
could do it first rate it seemed like he was just born for it and when
he had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way he
would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off 

the first chance we got the duke he had some showbills printed and after
that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was a most
uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but sword fighting and
rehearsing as the duke called it going on all the time one morning 
when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw we come in sight of a
little one horse town in a big bend so we tied up about three quarters
of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a
tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but jim took the canoe and
went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our
show 

we struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there that
afternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in in
all kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses the circus would leave
before night so our show would have a pretty good chance the duke he
hired the courthouse and we went around and stuck up our bills they
read like this

admission cents children and servants cents 

then we went loafing around town the stores and houses was most all
old shackly dried up frame concerns that hadnt ever been painted they
was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out of
reach of the water when the river was over flowed the houses had little
gardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything in
them but jimpson weeds and sunflowers and ash piles and old curled up
boots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and played out tinware 
the fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed on at different
times and they leaned every which way and had gates that didnt generly
have but one hinge a leather one some of the fences had been
white washed some time or another but the duke said it was in clumbus
time like enough there was generly hogs in the garden and people
driving them out 

all the stores was along one street they had white domestic awnings in
front and the country people hitched their horses to the awning posts 
there was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roosting on
them all day long whittling them with their barlow knives and chawing
tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretching a mighty ornery lot 
they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella but
didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another bill and
buck and hank and joe and andy and talked lazy and drawly and used
considerable many cuss words there was as many as one loafer leaning up
against every awning post and he most always had his hands in his
britches pockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of
tobacco or scratch what a body was hearing amongst them all the time
was 

 gimme a chaw v tobacker hank 

 caint i haint got but one chaw left ask bill 

maybe bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint got none 
some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor a chaw
of tobacco of their own they get all their chawing by borrowing they
say to a fellow i wisht youd len me a chaw jack i jist this minute
give ben thompson the last chaw i had which is a lie pretty much
everytime it dont fool nobody but a stranger but jack aint no
stranger so he says 

 you give him a chaw did you so did your sisters cats grandmother 
you pay me back the chaws youve awready borryd offn me lafe buckner 
then ill loan you one or two ton of it and wont charge you no back
intrust nuther 

 well i did pay you back some of it wunst 

 yes you did bout six chaws you borryd store tobacker and paid back
nigger head 

store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the
natural leaf twisted when they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut it
off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with
their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two 
then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when
its handed back and says sarcastic 

 here gimme the chaw and you take the plug 

all the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else but mud
 mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places and two
or three inches deep in all the places the hogs loafed and grunted
around everywheres youd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come
lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where
folks had to walk around her and shed stretch out and shut her eyes and
wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if
she was on salary and pretty soon youd hear a loafer sing out hi so
boy sick him tige and away the sow would go squealing most horrible 
with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more
a coming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing
out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise then
theyd settle back again till there was a dog fight there couldnt
anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog
fight unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting
fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to
death 

on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank and
they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in the people had
moved out of them the bank was caved away under one corner of some
others and that corner was hanging over people lived in them yet but
it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house
caves in at a time sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep
will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the
river in one summer such a town as that has to be always moving back 
and back and back because the rivers always gnawing at it 

the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons
and horses in the streets and more coming all the time families
fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the
wagons there was considerable whisky drinking going on and i seen
three fights by and by somebody sings out 

 here comes old boggs in from the country for his little old monthly
drunk here he comes boys 

all the loafers looked glad i reckoned they was used to having fun out
of boggs one of them says 

 wonder who hes a gwyne to chaw up this time if hed a chawed up all
the men hes ben a gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year hed have
considerable ruputation now 

another one says i wisht old boggs d threaten me cuz then id know i
warnt gwyne to die for a thousan year 

boggs comes a tearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an
injun and singing out 

 cler the track thar im on the waw path and the price uv coffins is
a gwyne to raise 

he was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year
old and had a very red face everybody yelled at him and laughed at him
and sassed him and he sassed back and said hed attend to them and lay
them out in their regular turns but he couldnt wait now because hed
come to town to kill old colonel sherburn and his motto was meat
first and spoon vittles to top off on 

he see me and rode up and says 

 whard you come fm boy you prepared to die 

then he rode on i was scared but a man says 

 he dont mean nothing hes always a carryin on like that when hes
drunk hes the best naturedest old fool in arkansaw never hurt nobody 
drunk nor sober 

boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so
he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells 

 come out here sherburn come out and meet the man youve swindled 
youre the houn im after and im a gwyne to have you too 

and so he went on calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
going on by and by a proud looking man about fifty five and he was a
heap the best dressed man in that town too steps out of the store and
the crowd drops back on each side to let him come he says to boggs 
mighty cam and slow he says 

 im tired of this but ill endure it till one oclock till one
oclock mind no longer if you open your mouth against me only once
after that time you cant travel so far but i will find you 

then he turns and goes in the crowd looked mighty sober nobody
stirred and there warnt no more laughing boggs rode off blackguarding
sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon
back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up some men
crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldnt they
told him it would be one oclock in about fifteen minutes and so he must
go home he must go right away but it didnt do no good he cussed
away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode
over it and pretty soon away he went a raging down the street again 
with his gray hair a flying everybody that could get a chance at him
tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up
and get him sober but it warnt no use up the street he would tear
again and give sherburn another cussing by and by somebody says 

 go for his daughter quick go for his daughter sometimes hell listen
to her if anybody can persuade him she can 

so somebody started on a run i walked down street a ways and stopped 
in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again but not on his
horse he was a reeling across the street towards me bare headed with
a friend on both sides of him a holt of his arms and hurrying him along 
he was quiet and looked uneasy and he warnt hanging back any but was
doing some of the hurrying himself somebody sings out 

 boggs 

i looked over there to see who said it and it was that colonel sherburn 
he was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in
his right hand not aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted
up towards the sky the same second i see a young girl coming on the
run and two men with her boggs and the men turned round to see who
called him and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side and
the pistol barrel come down slow and steady to a level both barrels
cocked boggs throws up both of his hands and says o lord dont
shoot bang goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the
air bang goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the
ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out that young girl
screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her
father crying and saying oh hes killed him hes killed him the
crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with
their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to
shove them back and shouting back back give him air give him air 

colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around
on his heels and walked off 

they took boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just
the same and the whole town following and i rushed and got a good place
at the window where i was close to him and could see in they laid him
on the floor and put one large bible under his head and opened another
one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and
i seen where one of the bullets went in he made about a dozen long
gasps his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath and
letting it down again when he breathed it out and after that he laid
still he was dead then they pulled his daughter away from him 
screaming and crying and took her off she was about sixteen and very
sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared 

well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and
pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that
had the places wouldnt give them up and folks behind them was saying
all the time say now youve looked enough you fellows taint right
and taint fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody
a chance other folks has their rights as well as you 

there was considerable jawing back so i slid out thinking maybe there
was going to be trouble the streets was full and everybody was
excited everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened 
and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows 
stretching their necks and listening one long lanky man with long
hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a
crooked handled cane marked out the places on the ground where boggs
stood and where sherburn stood and the people following him around from
one place to tother and watching everything he done and bobbing their
heads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their
hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his
cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood 
frowning and having his hat brim down over his eyes and sung out 
 boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says bang 
staggered backwards says bang again and fell down flat on his back 
the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was
just exactly the way it all happened then as much as a dozen people got
out their bottles and treated him 

well by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched in about a
minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and
snatching down every clothes line they come to to do the hanging with 




chapter xxii 

they swarmed up towards sherburns house a whooping and raging like
injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped
to mush and it was awful to see children was heeling it ahead of the
mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along
the road was full of womens heads and there was nigger boys in every
tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the
mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
reach lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scared most
to death 

they swarmed up in front of sherburns palings as thick as they could jam
together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise it was a
little twenty foot yard some sung out tear down the fence tear down
the fence then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing 
and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like
a wave 

just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch 
with a double barrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly cam
and deliberate not saying a word the racket stopped and the wave
sucked back 

sherburn never said a word just stood there looking down the
stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable sherburn run his eye slow
along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
out gaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky 
then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the
kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread thats got sand
in it 

then he says slow and scornful 

 the idea of you lynching anybody its amusing the idea of you
thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man because youre brave
enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast out women that come along
here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
man why a mans safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind as
long as its daytime and youre not behind him 

 do i know you i know you clear through was born and raised in the
south and ive lived in the north so i know the average all around 
the average mans a coward in the north he lets anybody walk over him
that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it 
in the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in
the daytime and robbed the lot your newspapers call you a brave people
so much that you think you are braver than any other people whereas
youre just as brave and no braver why dont your juries hang
murderers because theyre afraid the mans friends will shoot them in
the back in the dark and its just what they would do 

 so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred
masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal your mistake is that
you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and the other is
that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks you brought part
of a man buck harkness there and if you hadnt had him to start you 
youd a taken it out in blowing 

 you didnt want to come the average man dont like trouble and danger 
you dont like trouble and danger but if only half a man like buck
harkness there shouts lynch him lynch him youre afraid to back
down afraid youll be found out to be what you are cowards and so
you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that half a mans coat tail 
and come raging up here swearing what big things youre going to do 
the pitifulest thing out is a mob thats what an army is a mob they
dont fight with courage thats born in them but with courage thats
borrowed from their mass and from their officers but a mob without any
man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness now the thing for you to
do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole if any real
lynchings going to be done it will be done in the dark southern
fashion and when they come theyll bring their masks and fetch a man
along now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up
across his left arm and cocking it when he says this 

the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing
off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking
tolerable cheap i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want to 

i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
went by and then dived in under the tent i had my twenty dollar gold
piece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it because
there aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home
and amongst strangers that way you cant be too careful i aint
opposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way but
there aint no use in wasting it on them 

it was a real bully circus it was the splendidest sight that ever was
when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by
side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor
stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable
 there must a been twenty of them and every lady with a lovely
complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real
sure enough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars 
and just littered with diamonds it was a powerful fine sight i never
see anything so lovely and then one by one they got up and stood and
went a weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men
looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and
skimming along away up there under the tent roof and every ladys
rose leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking
like the most loveliest parasol 

and then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot
out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and
the ringmaster going round and round the center pole cracking his whip
and shouting hi hi and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by
and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on
her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did
lean over and hump themselves and so one after the other they all
skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then
scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about
wild 

well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and
all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people the
ringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever
could think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what i
couldnt noway understand why i couldnt a thought of them in a year 
and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring said he wanted to
ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was they argued
and tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show
come to a standstill then the people begun to holler at him and make
fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that
stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
benches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down throw him
out and one or two women begun to scream so then the ringmaster he
made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be no disturbance 
and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no more trouble he would
let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse so everybody
laughed and said all right and the man got on the minute he was on the
horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus
men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man
hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and
the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears
rolled down and at last sure enough all the circus men could do the
horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round
the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with
first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then tother
one on tother side and the people just crazy it warnt funny to me 
though i was all of a tremble to see his danger but pretty soon he
struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle a reeling this way and
that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood 
and the horse a going like a house afire too he just stood up there 
a sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warnt ever drunk in his
life and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them he shed
them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed
seventeen suits and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed
the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with
his whip and made him fairly hum and finally skipped off and made his
bow and danced off to the dressing room and everybody just a howling
with pleasure and astonishment 

then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was the sickest
ringmaster you ever see i reckon why it was one of his own men he
had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody 
well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldnt a been in
that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars i dont know there
may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them
yet anyways it was plenty good enough for me and wherever i run across
it it can have all of my custom every time 

well that night we had our show but there warnt only about twelve
people there just enough to pay expenses and they laughed all the
time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the
show was over but one boy which was asleep so the duke said these
arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to shakespeare what they wanted was
low comedy and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he
reckoned he said he could size their style so next morning he got
some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off
some handbills and stuck them up all over the village the bills said 

at the court house for nights only 
the world renowned tragedians
david garrick the younger 
and edmund kean the elder 
of the london and
continental theatres 
in their thrilling tragedy of
the kings cameleopard 
or the royal nonesuch 
admission cents 

then at the bottom was the biggest line of all which said 

ladies and children not admitted 

 there says he if that line dont fetch them i dont know arkansaw 




chapter xxiii 

well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a
curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was
jam full of men in no time when the place couldnt hold no more the
duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the
stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and
praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that
ever was and so he went on a bragging about the tragedy and about
edmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in it 
and at last when hed got everybodys expectations up high enough he
rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come a prancing out
on all fours naked and he was painted all over ring streaked and 
striped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow and but never
mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny 
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done
capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and
stormed and haw hawed till he come back and done it over again and after
that they made him do it another time well it would make a cow laugh to
see the shines that old idiot cut 

then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says
the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts of
pressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for it
in drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has
succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply
obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come
and see it 

twenty people sings out 

 what is it over is that all 

the duke says yes then there was a fine time everybody sings out 
 sold and rose up mad and was a going for that stage and them
tragedians but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts 

 hold on just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen we are
sold mighty badly sold but we dont want to be the laughing stock of
this whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long
as we live no what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this
show up and sell the rest of the town then well all be in the same
boat aint that sensible you bet it is the jedge is right 
everybody sings out all right then not a word about any sell go
along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy 

next day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendid that
show was house was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the
same way when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all
had a supper and by and by about midnight they made jim and me back
her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and
hide her about two mile below town 

the third night the house was crammed again and they warnt new comers
this time but people that was at the show the other two nights i stood
by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in had his
pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coat and i see it
warnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight i smelt sickly eggs
by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if i know the
signs of a dead cat being around and i bet i do there was sixty four of
them went in i shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for
me i couldnt stand it well when the place couldnt hold no more
people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for
him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i after him 
but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says 

 walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the
raft like the dickens was after you 

i done it and he done the same we struck the raft at the same time 
and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and
still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word 
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience 
but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam 
and says 

 well howd the old thing pan out this time duke he hadnt been
up town at all 

we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village 
then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed
their bones loose over the way theyd served them people the duke says 

 greenhorns flatheads i knew the first house would keep mum and let
the rest of the town get roped in and i knew theyd lay for us the third
night and consider it was their turn now well it is their turn and
id give something to know how much theyd take for it i would just
like to know how theyre putting in their opportunity they can turn it
into a picnic if they want to they brought plenty provisions 

them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty five dollars in that
three nights i never see money hauled in by the wagon load like that
before by and by when they was asleep and snoring jim says

tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a
thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and
called it domesday book which was a good name and stated the case you
dont know kings jim but i know them and this old rip of ourn is one
of the cleanest ive struck in history well henry he takes a notion he
wants to get up some trouble with this country how does he go at it
 give notice give the country a show no all of a sudden he heaves
all the tea in boston harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of
independence and dares them to come on that was his style he never
give anybody a chance he had suspicions of his father the duke of
wellington well what did he do ask him to show up no drownded
him in a butt of mamsey like a cat spose people left money laying
around where he was what did he do he collared it spose he
contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didnt set down there and
see that he done it what did he do he always done the other thing 
spose he opened his mouth what then if he didnt shut it up powerful
quick hed lose a lie every time thats the kind of a bug henry was 
and if wed a had him along stead of our kings hed a fooled that town a
heap worse than ourn done i dont say that ourn is lambs because they
aint when you come right down to the cold facts but they aint nothing
to that old ram anyway all i say is kings is kings and you got to
make allowances take them all around theyre a mighty ornery lot 
its the way theyre raised 

 but dis one do smell so like de nation huck 

 well they all do jim we cant help the way a king smells history
dont tell no way 

 now de duke hes a tolerble likely man in some ways 

 yes a dukes different but not very different this ones a middling
hard lot for a duke when hes drunk there aint no near sighted man
could tell him from a king 

 well anyways i doan hanker for no mo un um huck dese is all i kin
stan 

 its the way i feel too jim but weve got them on our hands and we
got to remember what they are and make allowances sometimes i wish we
could hear of a country thats out of kings 

what was the use to tell jim these warnt real kings and dukes it
wouldnt a done no good and besides it was just as i said you
couldnt tell them from the real kind 

i went to sleep and jim didnt call me when it was my turn he often
done that when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself i
didnt take notice nor let on i knowed what it was about he was
thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low
and homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in his
life and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
folks does for theirn it dont seem natural but i reckon its so he
was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was
asleep and saying po little lizabeth po little johnny its mighty
hard i spec i aint ever gwyne to see you no mo no mo he was a
mighty good nigger jim was

chapter xxiv 

next day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the
duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns jim he
spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a few hours 
because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all
day in the wigwam tied with the rope you see when we left him all
alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by
himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runaway nigger 
you know so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all
day and hed cipher out some way to get around it 

he was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it he dressed
jim up in king lears outfit it was a long curtain calico gown and a
white horse hair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and
painted jims face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull 
solid blue like a man thats been drownded nine days blamed if he
warnt the horriblest looking outrage i ever see then the duke took and
wrote out a sign on a shingle so 

sick arab but harmless when not out of his head 

and he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five
foot in front of the wigwam jim was satisfied he said it was a sight
better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all
over every time there was a sound the duke told him to make himself
free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out
of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild
beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone which
was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldnt
wait for him to howl why he didnt only look like he was dead he
looked considerable more than that 

these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there was so
much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybe the
news might a worked along down by this time they couldnt hit no
project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned hed
lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put up
something on the arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop
over to tother village without any plan but just trust in providence to
lead him the profitable way meaning the devil i reckon we had all
bought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put hisn
on and he told me to put mine on i done it of course the kings
duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy i never
knowed how clothes could change a body before why before he looked
like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take off his
new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and
good and pious that youd say he had walked right out of the ark and
maybe was old leviticus himself jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my
paddle ready there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up
under the point about three mile above the town been there a couple
of hours taking on freight says the king 

 seein how im dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st 
louis or cincinnati or some other big place go for the steamboat 
huckleberry well come down to the village on her 

i didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride i
fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting
along the bluff bank in the easy water pretty soon we come to a nice
innocent looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat
off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of
big carpet bags by him 

 run her nose in shore says the king i done it wher you bound
for young man 

 for the steamboat going to orleans 

 git aboard says the king hold on a minute my servant ll hep you
with them bags jump out and hep the gentleman adolphus meaning me 
i see 

i done so and then we all three started on again the young chap was
mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather 
he asked the king where he was going and the king told him hed come
down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he
was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the
young fellow says 

 when i first see you i says to myself its mr wilks sure and he
come mighty near getting here in time but then i says again no i
reckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river you
aint him are you 

 no my names blodgett elexander blodgett reverend elexander blodgett 
i spose i must say as im one o the lords poor servants but still
im jist as able to be sorry for mr wilks for not arriving in time all
the same if hes missed anything by it which i hope he hasnt 

 well he dont miss any property by it because hell get that all
right but hes missed seeing his brother peter die which he maynt
mind nobody can tell as to that but his brother would a give anything
in this world to see him before he died never talked about nothing else
all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boys together and
hadnt ever seen his brother william at all thats the deef and dumb
one william aint more than thirty or thirty five peter and george
were the only ones that come out here george was the married brother 
him and his wife both died last year harvey and williams the only ones
thats left now and as i was saying they havent got here in time 

 did anybody send em word 

 oh yes a month or two ago when peter was first took because peter
said then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well this time 
you see he was pretty old and georges gyirls was too young to be much
company for him except mary jane the red headed one and so he was
kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didnt seem to care
much to live he most desperately wanted to see harvey and william 
too for that matter because he was one of them kind that cant bear to
make a will he left a letter behind for harvey and said hed told in
it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property
divided up so georges gyirls would be all right for george didnt
leave nothing and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen
to 

 why do you reckon harvey dont come wher does he live 

 oh he lives in england sheffield preaches there hasnt ever been in
this country he hasnt had any too much time and besides he mightnt a
got the letter at all you know 

 too bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soul 
you going to orleans you say 

 yes but that aint only a part of it im going in a ship next
wednesday for ryo janeero where my uncle lives 

 its a pretty long journey but itll be lovely wisht i was a going 
is mary jane the oldest how old is the others 

 mary janes nineteen susans fifteen and joannas about fourteen
 thats the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare lip 


 poor things to be left alone in the cold world so 

 well they could be worse off old peter had friends and they aint
going to let them come to no harm theres hobson the babtis preacher 
and deacon lot hovey and ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi
bell the lawyer and dr robinson and their wives and the widow
bartley and well theres a lot of them but these are the ones that
peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote
home so harvey ll know where to look for friends when he gets here 

well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
that young fellow blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody and
everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and about
peters business which was a tanner and about georges which was a
carpenter and about harveys which was a dissentering minister and so
on and so on then he says 

 what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for 

 because shes a big orleans boat and i was afeard she mightnt stop
there when theyre deep they wont stop for a hail a cincinnati boat
will but this is a st louis one 

 was peter wilks well off 

 oh yes pretty well off he had houses and land and its reckoned he
left three or four thousand in cash hid up somers 

 when did you say he died 

 i didnt say but it was last night 

 funeral to morrow likely 

 yes bout the middle of the day 

 well its all terrible sad but weve all got to go one time or
another so what we want to do is to be prepared then were all right 

 yes sir its the best way ma used to always say that 

when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she
got off the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my
ride after all when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says 

 now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new
carpet bags and if hes gone over to tother side go over there and
git him and tell him to git himself up regardless shove along now 

i see what he was up to but i never said nothing of course when i got
back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and
the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said it
 every last word of it and all the time he was a doing it he tried to
talk like an englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch 
i cant imitate him and so i aint a going to try to but he really done
it pretty good then he says 

 how are you on the deef and dumb bilgewater 

the duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and
dumb person on the histronic boards so then they waited for a
steamboat 

about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along 
but they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last there was
a big one and they hailed her she sent out her yawl and we went
aboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wanted
to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and
said they wouldnt land us but the king was cam he says 

 if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant it 

so they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the
village they yawled us ashore about two dozen men flocked down when
they see the yawl a coming and when the king says 

 kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher mr peter wilks lives they give
a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say what
d i tell you then one of them says kind of soft and gentle 

 im sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live
yesterday evening 

sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up
against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his
back and says 

 alas alas our poor brother gone and we never got to see him oh 
its too too hard 

then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the
duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpet bag and bust out
a crying if they warnt the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever i
struck 

well the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said all
sorts of kind things to them and carried their carpet bags up the hill
for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about
his brothers last moments and the king he told it all over again on his
hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like
theyd lost the twelve disciples well if ever i struck anything like
it im a nigger it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race 




chapter xxv 

the news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the people
tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on
their coats as they come pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd 
and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march the windows and
dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence 

 is it them 

and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say 

 you bet it is 

when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the
three girls was standing in the door mary jane was red headed but that
dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and
her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncles was come 
the king he spread his arms and mary jane she jumped for them and the
hare lip jumped for the duke and there they had it everybody most 
leastways women cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have
such good times 

then the king he hunched the duke private i see him do it and then he
looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so
then him and the duke with a hand across each others shoulder and
tother hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybody
dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping 
people saying sh and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
their heads so you could a heard a pin fall and when they got there
they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then
they bust out a crying so you could a heard them to orleans most and
then they put their arms around each others necks and hung their chins
over each others shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe four i
never see two men leak the way they done and mind you everybody was
doing the same and the place was that damp i never see anything like it 
then one of them got on one side of the coffin and tother on tother
side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and
let on to pray all to themselves well when it come to that it worked
the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down
and went to sobbing right out loud the poor girls too and every woman 
nearly went up to the girls without saying a word and kissed them 
solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and
looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted
out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show i
never see anything so disgusting 

well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and works
himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle
about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the
diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of
four thousand mile but its a trial thats sweetened and sanctified to
us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out
of his heart and out of his brothers heart because out of their mouths
they cant words being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and
slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious
goody goody amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust 

and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd
struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might 
and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting
out music is a good thing and after all that soul butter and hogwash i
never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest and bully 

then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his
nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family
would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the
ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could
speak he knows who he would name for they was names that was very dear
to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same 
to wit as follows vizz rev mr hobson and deacon lot hovey and
mr ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell and dr robinson 
and their wives and the widow bartley 

rev hobson and dr robinson was down to the end of the town a hunting
together that is i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to tother
world and the preacher was pinting him right lawyer bell was away up
to louisville on business but the rest was on hand and so they all
come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him and
then they shook hands with the duke and didnt say nothing but just kept
a smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he
made all sorts of signs with his hands and said goo goo goo goo goo 
all the time like a baby that cant talk 

so the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much
everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little
things that happened one time or another in the town or to georges
family or to peter and he always let on that peter wrote him the
things but that was a lie he got every blessed one of them out of that
young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat 

then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the
king he read it out loud and cried over it it give the dwelling house
and three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyard
 which was doing a good business along with some other houses and land
 worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollars in gold to
harvey and william and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
cellar so these two frauds said theyd go and fetch it up and have
everything square and above board and told me to come with a candle we
shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it
out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yaller boys my 
the way the kings eyes did shine he slaps the duke on the shoulder and
says 

 oh this aint bully nor nothn oh no i reckon not why biljy it
beats the nonesuch dont it 

the duke allowed it did they pawed the yaller boys and sifted them
through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king
says 

 it aint no use talkin bein brothers to a rich dead man and
representatives of furrin heirs thats got left is the line for you and
me bilge thish yer comes of trustn to providence its the best way 
in the long run ive tried em all and ther aint no better way 

most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on
trust but no they must count it so they counts it and it comes out
four hundred and fifteen dollars short says the king 

 dern him i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
dollars 

they worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it then the
duke says 

 well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistake i reckon
thats the way of it the best ways to let it go and keep still about
it we can spare it 

 oh shucks yes we can spare it i dont kyer nothn bout that its
the count im thinkin about we want to be awful square and open and
above board here you know we want to lug this h yer money up stairs
and count it before everybody then ther aint nothn suspicious but
when the dead man says thers six thousn dollars you know we dont
want to 

 hold on says the duke les make up the deffisit and he begun to
haul out yaller boys out of his pocket 

 its a most amazn good idea duke you have got a rattlin clever head
on you says the king blest if the old nonesuch aint a heppin us
out agin and he begun to haul out yaller jackets and stack them up 

it most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear 

 say says the duke i got another idea les go up stairs and count
this money and then take and give it to the girls 

 good land duke lemme hug you its the most dazzling idea at ever a
man struck you have certnly got the most astonishin head i ever see 
oh this is the boss dodge ther aint no mistake bout it let em
fetch along their suspicions now if they want to this ll lay em out 

when we got up stairs everybody gethered around the table and the king
he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a pile twenty
elegant little piles everybody looked hungry at it and licked their
chops then they raked it into the bag again and i see the king begin
to swell himself up for another speech he says 

 friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them
thats left behind in the vale of sorrers he has done generous by these
yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and thats left
fatherless and motherless yes and we that knowed him knows that he
would a done more generous by em if he hadnt ben afeard o woundin his
dear william and me now wouldnt he ther aint no question bout it
in my mind well then what kind o brothers would it be that d stand
in his way at sech a time and what kind o uncles would it be that d
rob yes rob sech poor sweet lambs as these at he loved so at sech a
time if i know william and i think i do he well ill jest ask him 
he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his
hands and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather headed a while 
then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the
king goo gooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen
times before he lets up then the king says i knowed it i reckon that
ll convince anybody the way he feels about it here mary jane susan 
joanner take the money take it all its the gift of him that lays
yonder cold but joyful 

mary jane she went for him susan and the hare lip went for the duke and
then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet and everybody
crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook the hands off of
them frauds saying all the time 

 you dear good souls how lovely how could you 

well then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and
before long a big iron jawed man worked himself in there from outside 
and stood a listening and looking and not saying anything and nobody
saying anything to him either because the king was talking and they was
all busy listening the king was saying in the middle of something hed
started in on 

 they bein partickler friends o the diseased thats why theyre
invited here this evenin but tomorrow we want all to come everybody 
for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so its fitten that
his funeral orgies shd be public 

and so he went a mooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and
every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke
he couldnt stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper 
 obsequies you old fool and folds it up and goes to goo gooing and
reaching it over peoples heads to him the king he reads it and puts it
in his pocket and says 

 poor william afflicted as he is his hearts aluz right asks me to
invite everybody to come to the funeral wants me to make em all
welcome but he neednt a worried it was jest what i was at 

then he weaves along again perfectly cam and goes to dropping in his
funeral orgies again every now and then just like he done before and
when he done it the third time he says 

 i say orgies not because its the common term because it aint
 obsequies bein the common term but because orgies is the right term 
obsequies aint used in england no more now its gone out we say
orgies now in england orgies is better because it means the thing
youre after more exact its a word thats made up outn the greek
orgo outside open abroad and the hebrew jeesum to plant cover up 
hence inter so you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral 

he was the worst i ever struck well the iron jawed man he laughed
right in his face everybody was shocked everybody says why 
doctor and abner shackleford says 

 why robinson haint you heard the news this is harvey wilks 

the king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says 

 is it my poor brothers dear good friend and physician i 

 keep your hands off of me says the doctor you talk like an
englishman dont you its the worst imitation i ever heard you peter
wilkss brother youre a fraud thats what you are 

well how they all took on they crowded around the doctor and tried to
quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how harvey d
showed in forty ways that he was harvey and knowed everybody by name 
and the names of the very dogs and begged and begged him not to hurt
harveys feelings and the poor girls feelings and all that but it
warnt no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to
be an englishman and couldnt imitate the lingo no better than what he
did was a fraud and a liar the poor girls was hanging to the king and
crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them he says 

 i was your fathers friend and im your friend and i warn you as a
friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
harm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic greek and hebrew as
he calls it he is the thinnest kind of an impostor has come here with
a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres and you
take them for proofs and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish
friends here who ought to know better mary jane wilks you know me for
your friend and for your unselfish friend too now listen to me turn
this pitiful rascal out i beg you to do it will you 

mary jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome she
says 

 here is my answer she hove up the bag of money and put it in the
kings hands and says take this six thousand dollars and invest for
me and my sisters any way you want to and dont give us no receipt for
it 

then she put her arm around the king on one side and susan and the
hare lip done the same on the other everybody clapped their hands and
stomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up his
head and smiled proud the doctor says 

 all right i wash my hands of the matter but i warn you all that a
time s coming when youre going to feel sick whenever you think of this
day and away he went 

 all right doctor says the king kinder mocking him well try and
get em to send for you which made them all laugh and they said it was
a prime good hit 




chapter xxvi 

well when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off
for spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do for
uncle william and shed give her own room to uncle harvey which was a
little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it 
the king said the cubby would do for his valley meaning me 

so mary jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which was plain
but nice she said shed have her frocks and a lot of other traps took
out of her room if they was in uncle harveys way but he said they
warnt the frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a
curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor there was an old
hair trunk in one corner and a guitar box in another and all sorts of
little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a room
with the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
these fixings and so dont disturb them the dukes room was pretty
small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby 

that night they had a big supper and all them men and women was there 
and i stood behind the king and the dukes chairs and waited on them and
the niggers waited on the rest mary jane she set at the head of the
table with susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was 
and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the fried
chickens was and all that kind of rot the way women always do for to
force out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptop 
and said so said how do you get biscuits to brown so nice and where 
for the lands sake did you get these amazn pickles and all that kind
of humbug talky talk just the way people always does at a supper you
know 

and when it was all done me and the hare lip had supper in the kitchen
off of the leavings whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up
the things the hare lip she got to pumping me about england and blest
if i didnt think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes she says

in the palace at sheffield theyve got furnaces and he wants his water
hot they cant bile that amount of water away off there at the sea 
they havent got no conveniences for it

comfortable and glad next she says

rot him i forgot he was a preacher i see i was up a stump again so i
played another chicken bone and got another think then i says 

 blame it do you suppose there aint but one preacher to a church 

 why what do they want with more 

 what to preach before a king i never did see such a girl as you 
they dont have no less than seventeen

 shucks they dont all of em preach the same day only one of em 

 well then what does the rest of em do 

 oh nothing much loll around pass the plate and one thing or
another but mainly they dont do nothing 

 well then what are they for 

 why theyre for style dont you know nothing 

 well i dont want to know no such foolishness as that how is servants
treated in england do they treat em better n we treat our niggers 

 no a servant aint nobody there they treat them worse than dogs 

 dont they give em holidays the way we do christmas and new years

 oh just listen a body could tell you haint ever been to england by
that why hare l why joanna they never see a holiday from years end
to years end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor
nowheres 

 nor church 

 nor church 

 but you always went to church 

well i was gone up again i forgot i was the old mans servant but
next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was
different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted
to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law but
i didnt do it pretty good and when i got done i see she warnt
satisfied she says 

 honest injun now haint you been telling me a lot of lies 

 honest injun says i 

 none of it at all 

 none of it at all not a lie in it says i 

 lay your hand on this book and say it 

i see it warnt nothing but a dictionary so i laid my hand on it and
said it so then she looked a little better satisfied and says 

 well then ill believe some of it but i hope to gracious if ill
believe the rest 

 what is it you wont believe joe says mary jane stepping in with
susan behind her it aint right nor kind for you to talk so to him 
and him a stranger and so far from his people how would you like to be
treated so 

 thats always your way maim always sailing in to help somebody before
theyre hurt i haint done nothing to him hes told some stretchers 
i reckon and i said i wouldnt swallow it all and thats every bit and
grain i did say i reckon he can stand a little thing like that cant
he 

 i dont care whether twas little or whether twas big hes here in our
house and a stranger and it wasnt good of you to say it if you was in
his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtnt to say a
thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed 

 why maim he said 

 it dont make no difference what he said that aint the thing the
thing is for you to treat him kind and not be saying things to make him
remember he aint in his own country and amongst his own folks 

i says to myself this is a girl that im letting that old reptle rob her
of her money 

then susan she waltzed in and if youll believe me she did give
hare lip hark from the tomb 

says i to myself and this is another one that im letting him rob her of
her money 

then mary jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely
again which was her way but when she got done there warnt hardly
anything left o poor hare lip so she hollered 

 all right then says the other girls you just ask his pardon 

she done it too and she done it beautiful she done it so beautiful it
was good to hear and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies so she
could do it again 

i says to myself this is another one that im letting him rob her of her
money and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to
make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends i felt so ornery
and low down and mean that i says to myself my minds made up ill hive
that money for them or bust 

so then i lit out for bed i said meaning some time or another when i
got by myself i went to thinking the thing over i says to myself shall
i go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds no that wont
do he might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it
warm for me shall i go private and tell mary jane no i dasnt do
it her face would give them a hint sure theyve got the money and
theyd slide right out and get away with it if she was to fetch in help
id get mixed up in the business before it was done with i judge no 
there aint no good way but one i got to steal that money somehow and
i got to steal it some way that they wont suspicion that i done it 
theyve got a good thing here and they aint a going to leave till
theyve played this family and this town for all theyre worth so ill
find a chance time enough ill steal it and hide it and by and by when
im away down the river ill write a letter and tell mary jane where
its hid but i better hive it tonight if i can because the doctor
maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out
of here yet 

so thinks i ill go and search them rooms upstairs the hall was dark 
but i found the dukes room and started to paw around it with my hands 
but i recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to let anybody else
take care of that money but his own self so then i went to his room and
begun to paw around there but i see i couldnt do nothing without a
candle and i dasnt light one of course so i judged id got to do the
other thing lay for them and eavesdrop about that time i hears their
footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed i reached for it 
but it wasnt where i thought it would be but i touched the curtain that
hid mary janes frocks so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in
amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still 

they come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to
get down and look under the bed then i was glad i hadnt found the bed
when i wanted it and yet you know its kind of natural to hide under
the bed when you are up to anything private they sets down then and
the king says 

 well what is it and cut it middlin short because its better for us
to be down there a whoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a
chance to talk us over 

 well this is it capet i aint easy i aint comfortable that
doctor lays on my mind i wanted to know your plans ive got a notion 
and i think its a sound one 

 what is it duke 

 that we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip
it down the river with what weve got specially seeing we got it so
easy given back to us flung at our heads as you may say when of
course we allowed to have to steal it back im for knocking off and
lighting out 

that made me feel pretty bad about an hour or two ago it would a been a
little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed the king
rips out and says 

 what and not sell out the rest o the property march off like a
passel of fools and leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth o
property layin around jest sufferin to be scooped in and all good 
salable stuff too 

the duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didnt want
to go no deeper didnt want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they
had 

 why how you talk says the king we shant rob em of nothing at
all but jest this money the people that buys the property is the
suffrers because as soon s its found out at we didnt own it which
wont be long after weve slid the sale wont be valid and it ll all
go back to the estate these yer orphans ll git their house back agin 
and thats enough for them theyre young and spry and kn easy earn a
livin they aint a goin to suffer why jest think theres thousns
and thousns that aint nigh so well off bless you they aint got
nothn to complain of 

well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all
right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that
doctor hanging over them but the king says 

 cuss the doctor what do we kyer for him haint we got all the fools
in town on our side and aint that a big enough majority in any town 

so they got ready to go down stairs again the duke says 

 i dont think we put that money in a good place 

that cheered me up id begun to think i warnt going to get a hint of
no kind to help me the king says 

 why 

 because mary jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you know
the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up
and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not
borrow some of it 

 your heads level agin duke says the king and he comes a fumbling
under the curtain two or three foot from where i was i stuck tight to
the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and i wondered what them
fellows would say to me if they catched me and i tried to think what id
better do if they did catch me but the king he got the bag before i
could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned i
was around they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick
that was under the feather bed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst
the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up
the feather bed and dont turn over the straw tick only about twice a
year and so it warnt in no danger of getting stole now 

but i knowed better i had it out of there before they was half way down
stairs i groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till i could get
a chance to do better i judged i better hide it outside of the house
somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good
ransacking i knowed that very well then i turned in with my clothes
all on but i couldnt a gone to sleep if id a wanted to i was in such
a sweat to get through with the business by and by i heard the king and
the duke come up so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the
top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen but
nothing did 

so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadnt
begun yet and then i slipped down the ladder 




chapter xxvii 

i crept to their doors and listened they was snoring so i tiptoed
along and got down stairs all right there warnt a sound anywheres i
peeped through a crack of the dining room door and see the men that was
watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs the door was open
into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in
both rooms i passed along and the parlor door was open but i see there
warnt nobody in there but the remainders of peter so i shoved on by 
but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there just then i
heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me i run in the
parlor and took a swift look around and the only place i see to hide the
bag was in the coffin the lid was shoved along about a foot showing
the dead mans face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his
shroud on i tucked the money bag in under the lid just down beyond
where his hands was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and
then i run back across the room and in behind the door 

the person coming was mary jane she went to the coffin very soft and
kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and i see
she begun to cry though i couldnt hear her and her back was to me i
slid out and as i passed the dining room i thought id make sure them
watchers hadnt seen me so i looked through the crack and everything
was all right they hadnt stirred 

i slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing
playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much
resk about it says i if it could stay where it is all right because
when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to
mary jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint the
thing thats going to happen the thing thats going to happen is the
money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid then the king ll
get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybody another
chance to smouch it from him of course i wanted to slide down and get it
out of there but i dasnt try it every minute it was getting earlier
now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and i
might get catched catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that
nobody hadnt hired me to take care of i dont wish to be mixed up in
no such business as that i says to myself 

when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the
watchers was gone there warnt nobody around but the family and the
widow bartley and our tribe i watched their faces to see if anything
had been happening but i couldnt tell 

towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they
set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then
set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
hall and the parlor and the dining room was full i see the coffin lid
was the way it was before but i dasnt go to look in under it with
folks around 

then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls took seats
in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the
people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead
mans face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very
still and solemn only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to
their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing a little there
warnt no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and
blowing noses because people always blows them more at a funeral than
they do at other places except church 

when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the last touches and
getting people and things all ship shape and comfortable and making no
more sound than a cat he never spoke he moved people around he
squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and done it with nods 
and signs with his hands then he took his place over against the wall 
he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there
warnt no more smile to him than there is to a ham 

they had borrowed a melodeum a sick one and when everything was ready a
young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and
colicky and everybody joined in and sung and peter was the only one
that had a good thing according to my notion then the reverend hobson
opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most
outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only
one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right
along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and wait you
couldnt hear yourself think it was right down awkward and nobody
didnt seem to know what to do but pretty soon they see that
long legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say 
 dont you worry just depend on me then he stooped down and begun to
glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the peoples heads 
so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more
outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides
of the room he disappears down cellar then in about two seconds we
heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn
talk where he left off in a minute or two here comes this undertakers
back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and
glided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded his
mouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacher 
over the peoples heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper he had
a rat then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his
place you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because
naturally they wanted to know a little thing like that dont cost
nothing and its just the little things that makes a man to be looked up
to and liked there warnt no more popular man in town than what that
undertaker was 

well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and
then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at
last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
coffin with his screw driver i was in a sweat then and watched him
pretty keen but he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft
as mush and screwed it down tight and fast so there i was i didnt
know whether the money was in there or not so says i spose somebody
has hogged that bag on the sly now how do i know whether to write to
mary jane or not spose she dug him up and didnt find nothing what
would she think of me blame it i says i might get hunted up and
jailed id better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the
things awful mixed now trying to better it ive worsened it a hundred
times and i wish to goodness id just let it alone dad fetch the whole
business 

they buried him and we come back home and i went to watching faces
again i couldnt help it and i couldnt rest easy but nothing come
of it the faces didnt tell me nothing 

the king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up 
and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his
congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must
hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home he was
very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he could
stay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done and he
said of course him and william would take the girls home with them and
that pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixed
and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls too tickled
them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told
him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready them poor
things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting
fooled and lied to so but i didnt see no safe way for me to chip in and
change the general tune 

well blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the niggers and all
the property for auction straight off sale two days after the funeral 
but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to 

so the next day after the funeral along about noon time the girls joy
got the first jolt a couple of nigger traders come along and the king
sold them the niggers reasonable for three day drafts as they called it 
and away they went the two sons up the river to memphis and their
mother down the river to orleans i thought them poor girls and them
niggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other 
and took on so it most made me down sick to see it the girls said they
hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the
town i cant ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor
miserable girls and niggers hanging around each others necks and crying 
and i reckon i couldnt a stood it all but would a had to bust out and
tell on our gang if i hadnt knowed the sale warnt no account and the
niggers would be back home in a week or two 

the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out
flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
children that way it injured the frauds some but the old fool he
bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tell you
the duke was powerful uneasy 

next day was auction day about broad day in the morning the king and
the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look
that there was trouble the king says 

 was you in my room night before last 

 no your majesty which was the way i always called him when nobody but
our gang warnt around 

 was you in there yisterday er last night 

 no your majesty 

 honor bright now no lies 

 honor bright your majesty im telling you the truth i haint been
a near your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it
to you 

the duke says 

 have you seen anybody else go in there 

 no your grace not as i remember i believe 

 stop and think 

i studied awhile and see my chance then i says 

 well i see the niggers go in there several times 

both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt ever
expected it and then like they had then the duke says 

 what all of them 

 no leastways not all at once that is i dont think i ever see them
all come out at once but just one time 

 hello when was that 

 it was the day we had the funeral in the morning it warnt early 
because i overslept i was just starting down the ladder and i see
them 

 well go on go on what did they do howd they act 

 they didnt do nothing and they didnt act anyway much as fur as i
see they tiptoed away so i seen easy enough that theyd shoved in
there to do up your majestys room or something sposing you was up 
and found you warnt up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way
of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked you up 

 great guns this is a go says the king and both of them looked pretty
sick and tolerable silly they stood there a thinking and scratching
their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy
chuckle and says 

 it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand they let on to
be sorry they was going out of this region and i believed they was
sorry and so did you and so did everybody dont ever tell me any more
that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent why the way they played
that thing it would fool anybody in my opinion theres a fortune in
em if i had capital and a theater i wouldnt want a better lay out
than that and here weve gone and sold em for a song yes and aint
privileged to sing the song yet say where is that song that draft 

 in the bank for to be collected where would it be 

 well thats all right then thank goodness 

says i kind of timid like 

 is something gone wrong 

the king whirls on me and rips out 

 none o your business you keep your head shet and mind yr own
affairs if you got any long as youre in this town dont you forgit
that you hear then he says to the duke we got to jest swaller it
and say nothn mums the word for us 

as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and
says 

 quick sales and small profits its a good business yes 

the king snarls around on him and says 

 i was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick if the
profits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none to carry 
is it my fault any moren its yourn 

 well theyd be in this house yet and we wouldnt if i could a got my
advice listened to 

the king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around
and lit into me again he give me down the banks for not coming and
telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that way said
any fool would a knowed something was up and then waltzed in and cussed
himself awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking
his natural rest that morning and hed be blamed if hed ever do it
again so they went off a jawing and i felt dreadful glad id worked it
all off on to the niggers and yet hadnt done the niggers no harm by it 




chapter xxviii 

by and by it was getting up time so i come down the ladder and started
for down stairs but as i come to the girls room the door was open and
i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and shed
been packing things in it getting ready to go to england but she had
stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hands 
crying i felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would i went in
there and says 

 miss mary jane you cant a bear to see people in trouble and i cant
 most always tell me about it 

so she done it and it was the niggers i just expected it she said
the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her she didnt
know how she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the
children warnt ever going to see each other no more and then busted out
bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and says 

 oh dear dear to think they aint ever going to see each other any
more 

 but they will and inside of two weeks and i know it says i 

laws it was out before i could think and before i could budge she
throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again say it again 
say it again 

i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place 
i asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient
and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and eased up like a
person thats had a tooth pulled out so i went to studying it out i
says to myself i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is
in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though i aint had no
experience and cant say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and
yet heres a case where im blest if it dont look to me like the truth
is better and actuly safer than a lie i must lay it by in my mind and
think it over some time or other its so kind of strange and unregular 
i never see nothing like it well i says to myself at last im a going
to chance it ill up and tell the truth this time though it does seem
most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see
where youll go to then i says 

 miss mary jane is there any place out of town a little ways where you
could go and stay three or four days 

 yes mr lothrops why 

 never mind why yet if ill tell you how i know the niggers will see
each other again inside of two weeks here in this house and prove how i
know it will you go to mr lothrops and stay four days 

 four days she says ill stay a year 

 all right i says i dont want nothing more out of you than just your
word i druther have it than another mans kiss the bible she smiled
and reddened up very sweet and i says if you dont mind it ill shut
the door and bolt it 

then i come back and set down again and says 

 dont you holler just set still and take it like a man i got to tell
the truth and you want to brace up miss mary because its a bad kind 
and going to be hard to take but there aint no help for it these
uncles of yourn aint no uncles at all theyre a couple of frauds
 regular dead beats there now were over the worst of it you can stand
the rest middling easy 

it jolted her up like everything of course but i was over the shoal
water now so i went right along her eyes a blazing higher and higher
all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck
that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she
flung herself on to the kings breast at the front door and he kissed her
sixteen or seventeen times and then up she jumps with her face afire
like sunset and says 

 the brute come dont waste a minute not a second well have them
tarred and feathered and flung in the river 

says i 

 certnly but do you mean before you go to mr lothrops or 

 oh she says what am i thinking about she says and set right down
again dont mind what i said please dont you wont now will you 
laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would
die first i never thought i was so stirred up she says now go on 
and i wont do so any more you tell me what to do and whatever you say
ill do it 

 well i says its a rough gang them two frauds and im fixed so i
got to travel with them a while longer whether i want to or not i
druther not tell you why and if you was to blow on them this town would
get me out of their claws and id be all right but thered be another
person that you dont know about whod be in big trouble well we got
to save him haint we of course well then we wont blow on them 

saying them words put a good idea in my head i see how maybe i could
get me and jim rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave 
but i didnt want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
to answer questions but me so i didnt want the plan to begin working
till pretty late to night i says 

 miss mary jane ill tell you what well do and you wont have to stay
at mr lothrops so long nuther how fur is it 

 a little short of four miles right out in the country back here 

 well that ll answer now you go along out there and lay low till
nine or half past to night and then get them to fetch you home again
 tell them youve thought of something if you get here before eleven put
a candle in this window and if i dont turn up wait till eleven and
then if i dont turn up it means im gone and out of the way and safe 
then you come out and spread the news around and get these beats
jailed 

 good she says ill do it 

 and if it just happens so that i dont get away but get took up along
with them you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand and
you must stand by me all you can 

 stand by you indeed i will they shant touch a hair of your head 
she says and i see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said
it too 

 if i get away i shant be here i says to prove these rapscallions
aint your uncles and i couldnt do it if i was here i could swear
they was beats and bummers thats all though thats worth something 
well theres others can do that better than what i can and theyre
people that aint going to be doubted as quick as id be ill tell you
how to find them gimme a pencil and a piece of paper there royal
nonesuch bricksville put it away and dont lose it when the court
wants to find out something about these two let them send up to
bricksville and say theyve got the men that played the royal nonesuch 
and ask for some witnesses why youll have that entire town down here
before you can hardly wink miss mary and theyll come a biling too 

i judged we had got everything fixed about right now so i says 

 just let the auction go right along and dont worry nobody dont have
to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on
accounts of the short notice and they aint going out of this till they
get that money and the way weve fixed it the sale aint going to count 
and they aint going to get no money its just like the way it was with
the niggers it warnt no sale and the niggers will be back before
long why they cant collect the money for the niggers yet theyre in
the worst kind of a fix miss mary 

 well she says ill run down to breakfast now and then ill start
straight for mr lothrops 

 deed that aint the ticket miss mary jane i says by no manner of
means go before breakfast 

 why 

 what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for miss mary 

 well i never thought and come to think i dont know what was it 

 why its because you aint one of these leather face people i dont
want no better book than what your face is a body can set down and read
it off like coarse print do you reckon you can go and face your uncles
when they come to kiss you good morning and never 

 there there dont yes ill go before breakfast ill be glad to 
and leave my sisters with them 

 yes never mind about them theyve got to stand it yet a while they
might suspicion something if all of you was to go i dont want you to
see them nor your sisters nor nobody in this town if a neighbor was to
ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something no 
you go right along miss mary jane and ill fix it with all of them 
ill tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say youve went
away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change or to see a
friend and youll be back to night or early in the morning 

 gone to see a friend is all right but i wont have my love given to
them 

 well then it shant be it was well enough to tell her so no harm
in it it was only a little thing to do and no trouble and its the
little things that smooths peoples roads the most down here below it
would make mary jane comfortable and it wouldnt cost nothing then i
says theres one more thing that bag of money 

 well theyve got that and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how
they got it 

 no youre out there they haint got it 

 why whos got it 

 i wish i knowed but i dont i had it because i stole it from them 
and i stole it to give to you and i know where i hid it but im afraid
it aint there no more im awful sorry miss mary jane im just as
sorry as i can be but i done the best i could i did honest i come
nigh getting caught and i had to shove it into the first place i come
to and run and it warnt a good place 

 oh stop blaming yourself its too bad to do it and i wont allow it
 you couldnt help it it wasnt your fault where did you hide it 

i didnt want to set her to thinking about her troubles again and i
couldnt seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach so
for a minute i didnt say nothing then i says 

 id ruther not tell you where i put it miss mary jane if you dont
mind letting me off but ill write it for you on a piece of paper and
you can read it along the road to mr lothrops if you want to do you
reckon that ll do 

 oh yes 

so i wrote i put it in the coffin it was in there when you was
crying there away in the night i was behind the door and i was mighty
sorry for you miss mary jane 

it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own
roof shaming her and robbing her and when i folded it up and give it to
her i see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by the
hand hard and says 

 good bye im going to do everything just as youve told me and if i
dont ever see you again i shant ever forget you and ill think of
you a many and a many a time and ill pray for you too and she was
gone 

pray for me i reckoned if she knowed me shed take a job that was more
nearer her size but i bet she done it just the same she was just that
kind she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notion there
warnt no back down to her i judge you may say what you want to but
in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see in my
opinion she was just full of sand it sounds like flattery but it aint
no flattery and when it comes to beauty and goodness too she lays
over them all i haint ever seen her since that time that i see her go
out of that door no i haint ever seen her since but i reckon ive
thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her saying she
would pray for me and if ever id a thought it would do any good for me
to pray for her blamed if i wouldnt a done it or bust 

well mary jane she lit out the back way i reckon because nobody see
her go when i struck susan and the hare lip i says 

 whats the name of them people over on tother side of the river that
you all goes to see sometimes 

they says 

 theres several but its the proctors mainly 

 thats the name i says i most forgot it well miss mary jane she
told me to tell you shes gone over there in a dreadful hurry one of
thems sick 

 which one 

 i dont know leastways i kinder forget but i thinks its 

 sakes alive i hope it aint hanner 

 im sorry to say it i says but hanners the very one 

 my goodness and she so well only last week is she took bad 

 it aint no name for it they set up with her all night miss mary jane
said and they dont think shell last many hours 

 only think of that now whats the matter with her 

i couldnt think of anything reasonable right off that way so i says 

 mumps 

 mumps your granny they dont set up with people thats got the mumps 

 they dont dont they you better bet they do with these mumps these
mumps is different its a new kind miss mary jane said 

 hows it a new kind 

 because its mixed up with other things 

 what other things 

 well measles and whooping cough and erysiplas and consumption and
yaller janders and brain fever and i dont know what all 

 my land and they call it the mumps 

 thats what miss mary jane said 

 well what in the nation do they call it the mumps for 

 why because it is the mumps thats what it starts with 

 well ther aint no sense in it a body might stump his toe and take
pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains
out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull
up and say why he stumped his toe would ther be any sense in that 
no and ther aint no sense in this nuther is it ketching 

 is it ketching why how you talk is a harrow catching in the dark 
if you dont hitch on to one tooth youre bound to on another aint
you and you cant get away with that tooth without fetching the whole
harrow along can you well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow 
as you may say and it aint no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to
get it hitched on good 

 well its awful i think says the hare lip ill go to uncle harvey
and 

 oh yes i says i would of course i would i wouldnt lose no
time 

 well why wouldnt you 

 just look at it a minute and maybe you can see haint your uncles
obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can and do you
reckon theyd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
journey by yourselves you know theyll wait for you so fur so good 
your uncle harveys a preacher aint he very well then is a preacher
going to deceive a steamboat clerk is he going to deceive a ship clerk 
 so as to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard now you know he
aint what will he do then why hell say its a great pity but
my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my
niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus unum mumps and so its
my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to
show on her if shes got it but never mind if you think its best to
tell your uncle harvey 

 shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary janes
got it or not why you talk like a muggins 

 well anyway maybe youd better tell some of the neighbors 

 listen at that now you do beat all for natural stupidness cant you
see that theyd go and tell ther aint no way but just to not tell
anybody at all 

 well maybe youre right yes i judge you are right 

 but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey shes gone out a while 
anyway so he wont be uneasy about her 

 yes miss mary jane she wanted you to do that she says tell them to
give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss and say ive run over
the river to see mr mr what is the name of that rich family your
uncle peter used to think so much of i mean the one that 

 why you must mean the apthorps aint it 

 of course bother them kind of names a body cant ever seem to remember
them half the time somehow yes she said say she has run over for to
ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house 
because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody
else and shes going to stick to them till they say theyll come and
then if she aint too tired shes coming home and if she is shell be
home in the morning anyway she said dont say nothing about the
proctors but only about the apthorps which ll be perfectly true 
because she is going there to speak about their buying the house i know
it because she told me so herself 

 all right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give
them the love and the kisses and tell them the message 

everything was all right now the girls wouldnt say nothing because
they wanted to go to england and the king and the duke would ruther mary
jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor
robinson i felt very good i judged i had done it pretty neat i
reckoned tom sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself of course he
would a throwed more style into it but i cant do that very handy not
being brung up to it 

well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end
of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man
he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the
auctioneer and chipping in a little scripture now and then or a little
goody goody saying of some kind and the duke he was around goo gooing
for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly 

but by and by the thing dragged through and everything was sold
 everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard so theyd got
to work that off i never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting
to swallow everything well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed 
and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a whooping and yelling and
laughing and carrying on and singing out 

 heres your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs to old peter
wilks and you pays your money and you takes your choice 




chapter xxix 


they was fetching a very nice looking old gentleman along and a
nice looking younger one with his right arm in a sling and my souls 
how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up but i didnt see no
joke about it and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to
see any i reckoned theyd turn pale but no nary a pale did they
turn the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went
a goo gooing around happy and satisfied like a jug thats googling out
buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful
on them new comers like it give him the stomach ache in his very heart to
think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world oh he done
it admirable lots of the principal people gethered around the king to
let him see they was on his side that old gentleman that had just come
looked all puzzled to death pretty soon he begun to speak and i see
straight off he pronounced like an englishman not the kings way though
the kings was pretty good for an imitation i cant give the old gents
words nor i cant imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and
says about like this 

 this is a surprise to me which i wasnt looking for and ill
acknowledge candid and frank i aint very well fixed to meet it and
answer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes hes broke his arm 
and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night
by a mistake i am peter wilks brother harvey and this is his brother
william which cant hear nor speak and cant even make signs to amount
to much nowt hes only got one hand to work them with we are who we
say we are and in a day or two when i get the baggage i can prove it 
but up till then i wont say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait 

so him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and
blethers out 

 broke his arm very likely aint it and very convenient too for a
fraud thats got to make signs and aint learnt how lost their
baggage thats mighty good and mighty ingenious under the
circumstances 

so he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or
maybe half a dozen one of these was that doctor another one was a
sharp looking gentleman with a carpet bag of the old fashioned kind made
out of carpet stuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was
talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then
and nodding their heads it was levi bell the lawyer that was gone up to
louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and
listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king
now and when the king got done this husky up and says 

 say looky here if you are harvey wilks whend you come to this town 

 the day before the funeral friend says the king 

 but what time o day 

 in the evenin bout an hour er two before sundown 

 howd you come 

 i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati 

 well then howd you come to be up at the pint in the mornin in a
canoe 

 i warnt up at the pint in the mornin 

 its a lie 

several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
old man and a preacher 

 preacher be hanged hes a fraud and a liar he was up at the pint that
mornin i live up there dont i well i was up there and he was up
there i see him there he come in a canoe along with tim collins and
a boy 

the doctor he up and says 

 would you know the boy again if you was to see him hines 

 i reckon i would but i dont know why yonder he is now i know him
perfectly easy 

it was me he pointed at the doctor says 

 neighbors i dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if
these two aint frauds i am an idiot thats all i think its our duty
to see that they dont get away from here till weve looked into this
thing come along hines come along the rest of you well take these
fellows to the tavern and affront them with tother couple and i reckon
well find out something before we get through 

it was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings friends so we
all started it was about sundown the doctor he led me along by the
hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand 

we all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles and
fetched in the new couple first the doctor says 

 i dont wish to be too hard on these two men but i think theyre
frauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about if
they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks
left it aint unlikely if these men aint frauds they wont object
to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove theyre
all right aint that so 

everybody agreed to that so i judged they had our gang in a pretty
tight place right at the outstart but the king he only looked
sorrowful and says 

 gentlemen i wish the money was there for i aint got no disposition to
throw anything in the way of a fair open out and out investigation o
this misable business but alas the money aint there you kn send and
see if you want to 

 where is it then 

 well when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it
inside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the few
days wed be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not bein
used to niggers and supposn em honest like servants in england the
niggers stole it the very next mornin after i had went down stairs and
when i sold em i hadnt missed the money yit so they got clean away
with it my servant here kn tell you bout it gentlemen 

the doctor and several said shucks and i see nobody didnt altogether
believe him one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it i said no 
but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and i never
thought nothing only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my
master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them that
was all they asked me then the doctor whirls on me and says 

 are you english too 

i says yes and him and some others laughed and said stuff 

well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had
it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about
supper nor ever seemed to think about it and so they kept it up and
kept it up and it was the worst mixed up thing you ever see they made
the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell hisn and
anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old
gentleman was spinning truth and tother one lies and by and by they
had me up to tell what i knowed the king he give me a left handed look
out of the corner of his eye and so i knowed enough to talk on the right
side i begun to tell about sheffield and how we lived there and all
about the english wilkses and so on but i didnt get pretty fur till
the doctor begun to laugh and levi bell the lawyer says 

 set down my boy i wouldnt strain myself if i was you i reckon you
aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want is
practice you do it pretty awkward 

i didnt care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to be let off 
anyway 

the doctor he started to say something and turns and says 

 if youd been in town at first levi bell the king broke in and
reached out his hand and says 

 why is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so often
about 

the lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased 
and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked
low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says 

 that ll fix it ill take the order and send it along with your
brothers and then theyll know its all right 

so they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted
his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something 
and then they give the pen to the duke and then for the first time the
duke looked sick but he took the pen and wrote so then the lawyer
turns to the new old gentleman and says 

 you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names 

the old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it the lawyer looked
powerful astonished and says 

 well it beats me and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket 
and examined them and then examined the old mans writing and then them
again and then says these old letters is from harvey wilks and
heres these two handwritings and anybody can see they didnt write
them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish i tell you to see
how the lawyer had took them in and heres this old gentlemans hand
writing and anybody can tell easy enough he didnt write them fact
is the scratches he makes aint properly writing at all now heres
some letters from 

the new old gentleman says 

 if you please let me explain nobody can read my hand but my brother
there so he copies for me its his hand youve got there not mine 

 well says the lawyer this is a state of things ive got some of
williams letters too so if youll get him to write a line or so we can
com 

 he cant write with his left hand says the old gentleman if he
could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and
mine too look at both please theyre by the same hand 

the lawyer done it and says 

 i believe its so and if it aint so theres a heap stronger
resemblance than id noticed before anyway well well well i
thought we was right on the track of a solution but its gone to grass 
partly but anyway one thing is proved these two aint either of em
wilkses and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke 

well what do you think that muleheaded old fool wouldnt give in then 
indeed he wouldnt said it warnt no fair test said his brother
william was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt tried to write
 he see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the
pen to paper and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right
along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying
himself but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and says 

 ive thought of something is there anybody here that helped to lay out
my br helped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying 

 yes says somebody me and ab turner done it were both here 

then the old man turns towards the king and says 

 perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast 

blamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or hed a
squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him
so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most
anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice 
because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man he
whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still in there 
and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him says i to
myself now hell throw up the sponge there aint no more use well 
did he a body cant hardly believe it but he didnt i reckon he
thought hed keep the thing up till he tired them people out so theyd
thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away anyway 
he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says 

 mf its a very tough question aint it yes sir i kn tell you
whats tattooed on his breast its jest a small thin blue arrow
 thats what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it now
what do you say hey 

well i never see anything like that old blister for clean out and out
cheek 

the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard and his
eye lights up like he judged hed got the king this time and says 

 there youve heard what he said was there any such mark on peter
wilks breast 

both of them spoke up and says 

 we didnt see no such mark 

 good says the old gentleman now what you did see on his breast was
a small dim p and a b which is an initial he dropped when he was
young and a w with dashes between them so p b w and he marked
them that way on a piece of paper come aint that what you saw 

both of them spoke up again and says 

 no we didnt we never seen any marks at all 

well everybody was in a state of mind now and they sings out 

 the whole bilin of m s frauds les duck em les drown em les
ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and there was a
rattling powwow but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and
says 

 gentlemen gentlemen hear me just a word just a single word if you
please theres one way yet lets go and dig up the corpse and look 

that took them 

 hooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer
and the doctor sung out 

 hold on hold on collar all these four men and the boy and fetch them
along too 

 well do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks well
lynch the whole gang 

i was scared now i tell you but there warnt no getting away you
know they gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the
graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town
at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the
evening 

as we went by our house i wished i hadnt sent mary jane out of town 
because now if i could tip her the wink shed light out and save me and
blow on our dead beats 

well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like
wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the
lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst
the leaves this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever
was in and i was kinder stunned everything was going so different from
what i had allowed for stead of being fixed so i could take my own time
if i wanted to and see all the fun and have mary jane at my back to
save me and set me free when the close fit come here was nothing in the
world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo marks if they
didnt find them 

i couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldnt think
about nothing else it got darker and darker and it was a beautiful
time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wrist
 hines and a body might as well try to give goliar the slip he dragged
me right along he was so excited and i had to run to keep up 

when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
like an overflow and when they got to the grave they found they had
about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadnt
thought to fetch a lantern but they sailed into digging anyway by the
flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a
mile off to borrow one 

so they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain
started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come
brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took
no notice of it they was so full of this business and one minute you
could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls
of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped
it all out and you couldnt see nothing at all 

at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then
such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to
scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it
was awful hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and i
reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excited and panting 

all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and
somebody sings out 

 by the living jingo heres the bag of gold on his breast 

hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give
a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way i lit out and
shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can tell 

i had the road all to myself and i fairly flew leastways i had it all
to myself except the solid dark and the now and then glares and the
buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of
the thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it along 

when i struck the town i see there warnt nobody out in the storm so i
never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main
one and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it 
no light there the house all dark which made me feel sorry and
disappointed i didnt know why but at last just as i was sailing by 
flash comes the light in mary janes window and my heart swelled up
sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me
in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in this world 
she was the best girl i ever see and had the most sand 

the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the
towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time
the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained i snatched it and shoved 
it was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope the towhead
was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the
river but i didnt lose no time and when i struck the raft at last i
was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could
afforded it but i didnt as i sprung aboard i sung out 

 out with you jim and set her loose glory be to goodness were shut
of them 

jim lit out and was a coming for me with both arms spread he was so
full of joy but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in
my mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was old king
lear and a drownded a rab all in one and it most scared the livers and
lights out of me but jim fished me out and was going to hug me and
bless me and so on he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the
king and the duke but i says 

 not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast cut loose and
let her slide 

so in two seconds away we went a sliding down the river and it did seem
so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and
nobody to bother us i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack
my heels a few times i couldnt help it but about the third crack i
noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well and held my breath and
listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over
the water here they come and just a laying to their oars and making
their skiff hum it was the king and the duke 

so i wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all
i could do to keep from crying 




chapter xxx 

when they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar 
and says 

 tryin to give us the slip was ye you pup tired of our company 
hey 

i says 

 no your majesty we warnt please dont your majesty 

 quick then and tell us what was your idea or ill shake the insides
out o you 

 honest ill tell you everything just as it happened your majesty the
man that had a holt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a
boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy
in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by
finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and
whispers heel it now or theyll hang ye sure and i lit out it
didnt seem no good for me to stay i couldnt do nothing and i didnt
want to be hung if i could get away so i never stopped running till i
found the canoe and when i got here i told jim to hurry or theyd catch
me and hang me yet and said i was afeard you and the duke wasnt alive
now and i was awful sorry and so was jim and was awful glad when we
see you coming you may ask jim if i didnt 

jim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said oh yes 
its mighty likely and shook me up again and said he reckoned hed
drownd me but the duke says 

 leggo the boy you old idiot would you a done any different did you
inquire around for him when you got loose i dont remember it 

so the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in
it but the duke says 

 you better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing for youre the
one thats entitled to it most you haint done a thing from the start
that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that
imaginary blue arrow mark that was bright it was right down bully and
it was the thing that saved us for if it hadnt been for that theyd a
jailed us till them englishmens baggage come and then the
penitentiary you bet but that trick took em to the graveyard and the
gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadnt let
go all holts and made that rush to get a look wed a slept in our cravats
to night cravats warranted to wear too longer than wed need em 

they was still a minute thinking then the king says kind of
absent minded like 

 mf and we reckoned the niggers stole it 

that made me squirm 

 yes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic we did 

after about a half a minute the king drawls out 

 leastways i did 

the duke says the same way 

 on the contrary i did 

the king kind of ruffles up and says 

 looky here bilgewater whatr you referrin to 

the duke says pretty brisk 

 when it comes to that maybe youll let me ask what was you referring
to 

 shucks says the king very sarcastic but i dont know maybe you was
asleep and didnt know what you was about 

the duke bristles up now and says 

 oh let up on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fool 
dont you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin 

 yes sir i know you do know because you done it yourself 

 its a lie and the duke went for him the king sings out 

 take yr hands off leggo my throat i take it all back 

the duke says 

 well you just own up first that you did hide that money there 
intending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and dig it
up and have it all to yourself 

 wait jest a minute duke answer me this one question honest and fair 
if you didnt put the money there say it and ill blieve you and take
back everything i said 

 you old scoundrel i didnt and you know i didnt there now 

 well then i blieve you but answer me only jest this one more now
dont git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide
it 

the duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says 

 well i dont care if i did i didnt do it anyway but you not only
had it in mind to do it but you done it 

 i wisht i never die if i done it duke and thats honest i wont say
i warnt goin to do it because i was but you i mean somebody got in
ahead o me 

 its a lie you done it and you got to say you done it or 

the king began to gurgle and then he gasps out 

 nough i own up 

i was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier
than what i was feeling before so the duke took his hands off and says 

 if you ever deny it again ill drown you its well for you to set
there and blubber like a baby its fitten for you after the way youve
acted i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything
 and i a trusting you all the time like you was my own father you ought
to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot
of poor niggers and you never say a word for em it makes me feel
ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage cuss you 
i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit you wanted
to get what money id got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another 
and scoop it all 

the king says timid and still a snuffling 

 why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt me 

 dry up i dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke and
now you see what you got by it theyve got all their own money back 
and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides glong to bed and dont
you deffersit me no more deffersits long s you live 

so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort 
and before long the duke tackled his bottle and so in about a half an
hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the
lovinger they got and went off a snoring in each others arms they
both got powerful mellow but i noticed the king didnt get mellow enough
to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money bag again that
made me feel easy and satisfied of course when they got to snoring we
had a long gabble and i told jim everything 




chapter xxxi 

we dasnt stop again at any town for days and days kept right along down
the river we was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long
ways from home we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them 
hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards it was the first i
ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn and dismal so
now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work
the villages again 

first they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enough for
them both to get drunk on then in another village they started a
dancing school but they didnt know no more how to dance than a kangaroo
does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and
pranced them out of town another time they tried to go at yellocution 
but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a
solid good cussing and made them skip out they tackled missionarying 
and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of
everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck so at last they got
just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along 
thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a
time and dreadful blue and desperate 

and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time 
jim and me got uneasy we didnt like the look of it we judged they
was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever we turned it over
and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into
somebodys house or store or was going into the counterfeit money
business or something so then we was pretty scared and made up an
agreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with such
actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
shake and clear out and leave them behind well early one morning we hid
the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a
shabby village named pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us
all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if
anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet house to rob 
you mean says i to myself and when you get through robbing it youll
come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raft and
youll have to take it out in wondering and he said if he warnt back
by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come
along 

so we stayed where we was the duke he fretted and sweated around and
was in a mighty sour way he scolded us for everything and we couldnt
seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing 
something was a brewing sure i was good and glad when midday come and
no king we could have a change anyway and maybe a chance for the
change on top of it so me and the duke went up to the village and
hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back
room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport and he a cussing and a threatening with all
his might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing to
them the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun
to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook
the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road like a deer 
for i see our chance and i made up my mind that it would be a long day
before they ever see me and jim again i got down there all out of
breath but loaded up with joy and sung out 

 set her loose jim were all right now 

but there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam jim was
gone i set up a shout and then another and then another one and run
this way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warnt no
use old jim was gone then i set down and cried i couldnt help it 
but i couldnt set still long pretty soon i went out on the road 
trying to think what i better do and i run across a boy walking and
asked him if hed seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says 

 yes 

 whereabouts says i 

 down to silas phelps place two mile below here hes a runaway
nigger and theyve got him was you looking for him 

 you bet i aint i run across him in the woods about an hour or two
ago and he said if i hollered hed cut my livers out and told me to lay
down and stay where i was and i done it been there ever since afeard
to come out 

 well he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz theyve got him 
he run off fm down south somers 

 its a good job they got him 

 well i reckon theres two hunderd dollars reward on him its like
picking up money outn the road 

 yes it is and i could a had it if id been big enough i see him
first who nailed him 

 it was an old fellow a stranger and he sold out his chance in him for
forty dollars becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait think
o that now you bet id wait if it was seven year 

 thats me every time says i but maybe his chance aint worth no
more than that if hell sell it so cheap maybe theres something aint
straight about it 

 but it is though straight as a string i see the handbill myself it
tells all about him to a dot paints him like a picture and tells the
plantation hes frum below newrleans no sirree bob they aint no
trouble bout that speculation you bet you say gimme a chaw tobacker 
wont ye 

i didnt have none so he left i went to the raft and set down in the
wigwam to think but i couldnt come to nothing i thought till i wore
my head sore but i couldnt see no way out of the trouble after all
this long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrels here it
was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because
they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that and make him
a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty
dollars 

once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a
slave at home where his family was as long as hed got to be a slave 
and so id better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss
watson where he was but i soon give up that notion for two things 
shed be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for
leaving her and so shed sell him straight down the river again and if
she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and theyd
make jim feel it all the time and so hed feel ornery and disgraced 
and then think of me it would get all around that huck finn helped a
nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to see anybody from that
town again id be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame thats
just the way a person does a low down thing and then he dont want to
take no consequences of it thinks as long as he can hide it it aint no
disgrace that was my fix exactly the more i studied about this the
more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and low down
and ornery i got to feeling and at last when it hit me all of a sudden
that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and
letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up
there in heaven whilst i was stealing a poor old womans nigger that
hadnt ever done me no harm and now was showing me theres one thats
always on the lookout and aint a going to allow no such miserable
doings to go only just so fur and no further i most dropped in my tracks
i was so scared well i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up
somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked and so i warnt so
much to blame but something inside of me kept saying there was the
sunday school you could a gone to it and if youd a done it theyd a
learnt you there that people that acts as id been acting about that
nigger goes to everlasting fire 

it made me shiver and i about made up my mind to pray and see if i
couldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better so i
kneeled down but the words wouldnt come why wouldnt they it
warnt no use to try and hide it from him nor from me neither i
knowed very well why they wouldnt come it was because my heart warnt
right it was because i warnt square it was because i was playing
double i was letting on to give up sin but away inside of me i was
holding on to the biggest one of all i was trying to make my mouth say
i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that
niggers owner and tell where he was but deep down in me i knowed it was
a lie and he knowed it you cant pray a lie i found that out 

so i was full of trouble full as i could be and didnt know what to do 
at last i had an idea and i says ill go and write the letter and then
see if i can pray why it was astonishing the way i felt as light as a
feather right straight off and my troubles all gone so i got a piece
of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote 

miss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below
pikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
reward if you send 

huck finn 

i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever
felt so in my life and i knowed i could pray now but i didnt do it
straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinking thinking
how good it was all this happened so and how near i come to being lost
and going to hell and went on thinking and got to thinking over our
trip down the river and i see jim before me all the time in the day
and in the night time sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we
a floating along talking and singing and laughing but somehow i
couldnt seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only the
other kind id see him standing my watch on top of hisn stead of
calling me so i could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when i
come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up
there where the feud was and such like times and would always call me
honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how
good he always was and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling
the men we had small pox aboard and he was so grateful and said i was
the best friend old jim ever had in the world and the only one hes got
now and then i happened to look around and see that paper 

it was a close place i took it up and held it in my hand i was
a trembling because id got to decide forever betwixt two things and
i knowed it i studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then
says to myself 

 all right then ill go to hell and tore it up 

it was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said and i let them
stay said and never thought no more about reforming i shoved the whole
thing out of my head and said i would take up wickedness again which
was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt and for a
starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again and if i
could think up anything worse i would do that too because as long as i
was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog 

then i set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some
considerable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that
suited me so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down
the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my
raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in i slept the
night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and
put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing or another
in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore i landed below
where i judged was phelpss place and hid my bundle in the woods and
then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk
her where i could find her again when i wanted her about a quarter of a
mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank 

then i struck up the road and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it 
 phelpss sawmill and when i come to the farm houses two or three
hundred yards further along i kept my eyes peeled but didnt see nobody
around though it was good daylight now but i didnt mind because i
didnt want to see nobody just yet i only wanted to get the lay of the
land according to my plan i was going to turn up there from the
village not from below so i just took a look and shoved along 
straight for town well the very first man i see when i got there was
the duke he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuch three night
performance like that other time they had the cheek them frauds i
was right on him before i could shirk he looked astonished and says 

 hel lo whered you come from then he says kind of glad and eager 
 wheres the raft got her in a good place 

i says 

 why thats just what i was going to ask your grace 

then he didnt look so joyful and says 

 what was your idea for asking me he says 

 well i says when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to
myself we cant get him home for hours till hes soberer so i went
a loafing around town to put in the time and wait a man up and offered
me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a
sheep and so i went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and
the man left me a holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after
him we didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the
country till we tired him out we never got him till dark then we
fetched him over and i started down for the raft when i got there and
see it was gone i says to myself theyve got into trouble and had to
leave and theyve took my nigger which is the only nigger ive got in
the world and now im in a strange country and aint got no property no
more nor nothing and no way to make my living so i set down and
cried i slept in the woods all night but what did become of the raft 
then and jim poor jim 

 blamed if i know that is whats become of the raft that old fool had
made a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggery
the loafers had matched half dollars with him and got every cent but what
hed spent for whisky and when i got him home late last night and found
the raft gone we said that little rascal has stole our raft and shook
us and run off down the river 

 i wouldnt shake my nigger would i the only nigger i had in the
world and the only property 

 we never thought of that fact is i reckon wed come to consider him
our nigger yes we did consider him so goodness knows we had trouble
enough for him so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke 
there warnt anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake 
and ive pegged along ever since dry as a powder horn wheres that ten
cents give it here 

i had considerable money so i give him ten cents but begged him to
spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the
money i had and i hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday he never
said nothing the next minute he whirls on me and says 

 do you reckon that nigger would blow on us wed skin him if he done
that 

 how can he blow haint he run off 

 no that old fool sold him and never divided with me and the moneys
gone 

 sold him i says and begun to cry why he was my nigger and that
was my money where is he i want my nigger 

 well you cant get your nigger thats all so dry up your blubbering 
looky here do you think youd venture to blow on us blamed if i think
id trust you why if you was to blow on us 

he stopped but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before 
i went on a whimpering and says 

 i dont want to blow on nobody and i aint got no time to blow nohow 
i got to turn out and find my nigger 

he looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on
his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead at last he says 

 ill tell you something we got to be here three days if youll
promise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow ill tell you
where to find him 

so i promised and he says 

 a farmer by the name of silas ph and then he stopped you see he
started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to
study and think again i reckoned he was changing his mind and so he
was he wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the
way the whole three days so pretty soon he says 

 the man that bought him is named abram foster abram g foster and he
lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to lafayette 

 all right i says i can walk it in three days and ill start this
very afternoon 

 no you wont youll start now and dont you lose any time about it 
neither nor do any gabbling by the way just keep a tight tongue in
your head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble with
us dye hear 

that was the order i wanted and that was the one i played for i wanted
to be left free to work my plans 

 so clear out he says and you can tell mr foster whatever you want
to maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your nigger some idiots
dont require documents leastways ive heard theres such down south
here and when you tell him the handbill and the rewards bogus maybe
hell believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting
em out go long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you
dont work your jaw any between here and there 

so i left and struck for the back country i didnt look around but i
kinder felt like he was watching me but i knowed i could tire him out
at that i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i
stopped then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps i
reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
around because i wanted to stop jims mouth till these fellows could get
away i didnt want no trouble with their kind id seen all i wanted
to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them 




chapter xxxii 

when i got there it was all still and sunday like and hot and sunshiny 
the hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
like everybodys dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers
the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like its spirits
whispering spirits thats been dead ever so many years and you always
think theyre talking about you as a general thing it makes a body wish
he was dead too and done with it all 

phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they
all look alike a rail fence round a two acre yard a stile made out of
logs sawed off and up ended in steps like barrels of a different length 
to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on when they are
going to jump on to a horse some sickly grass patches in the big yard 
but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed
off big double log house for the white folks hewed logs with the
chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mud stripes been
whitewashed some time or another round log kitchen with a big broad 
open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smoke house back of
the kitchen three little log nigger cabins in a row tother side the
smoke house one little hut all by itself away down against the back
fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ash hopper and
big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door 
with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more
hounds asleep round about about three shade trees away off in a corner 
some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence 
outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton
fields begins and after the fields the woods 

i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash hopper and
started for the kitchen when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of
a spinning wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then
i knowed for certain i wished i was dead for that is the lonesomest
sound in the whole world 

i went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting
to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for
id noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if
i left it alone 

when i got half way first one hound and then another got up and went for
me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still and such
another powwow as they made in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a
hub of a wheel as you may say spokes made out of dogs circle of
fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses
stretched up towards me a barking and howling and more a coming you
could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres 

a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling pin in her
hand singing out begone you tige you spot begone sah and she
fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling 
and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back 
wagging their tails around me and making friends with me there aint
no harm in a hound nohow 

and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
boys without anything on but tow linen shirts and they hung on to their
mothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way
they always do and here comes the white woman running from the house 
about forty five or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinning stick in
her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same
way the little niggers was doing she was smiling all over so she could
hardly stand and says 

 its you at last aint it 

i out with a yesm before i thought 

she grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and
shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and
she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying you dont
look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would but law sakes i
dont care for that im so glad to see you dear dear it does seem
like i could eat you up children its your cousin tom tell him
howdy 

but they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and
hid behind her so she run on 

 lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away or did you get
your breakfast on the boat 

i said i had got it on the boat so then she started for the house 
leading me by the hand and the children tagging after when we got
there she set me down in a split bottomed chair and set herself down on
a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says 

 now i can have a good look at you and laws a me ive been hungry for
it a many and a many a time all these long years and its come at last 
we been expecting you a couple of days and more what kep you boat
get aground 

 yesm she 

 dont say yesm say aunt sally whered she get aground 

i didnt rightly know what to say because i didnt know whether the boat
would be coming up the river or down but i go a good deal on instinct 
and my instinct said she would be coming up from down towards orleans 
that didnt help me much though for i didnt know the names of bars
down that way i see id got to invent a bar or forget the name of the
one we got aground on or now i struck an idea and fetched it out 

 it warnt the grounding that didnt keep us back but a little we
blowed out a cylinder head 

 good gracious anybody hurt 

 nom killed a nigger 

 well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt two years ago
last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old
lally rook and she blowed out a cylinder head and crippled a man and i
think he died afterwards he was a baptist your uncle silas knowed a
family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well yes i remember
now he did die mortification set in and they had to amputate him 
but it didnt save him yes it was mortification that was it he
turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection 
they say he was a sight to look at your uncles been up to the town
every day to fetch you and hes gone again not moren an hour ago 
hell be back any minute now you must a met him on the road didnt
you oldish man with a 

 no i didnt see nobody aunt sally the boat landed just at daylight 
and i left my baggage on the wharf boat and went looking around the town
and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too
soon and so i come down the back way 

 whod you give the baggage to 

 nobody 

 why child it ll be stole 

 not where i hid it i reckon it wont i says 

 howd you get your breakfast so early on the boat 

it was kinder thin ice but i says 

 the captain see me standing around and told me i better have something
to eat before i went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers
lunch and give me all i wanted 

i was getting so uneasy i couldnt listen good i had my mind on the
children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them
a little and find out who i was but i couldnt get no show mrs 
phelps kept it up and run on so pretty soon she made the cold chills
streak all down my back because she says 

 but here were a running on this way and you haint told me a word
about sis nor any of them now ill rest my works a little and you
start up yourn just tell me everything tell me all about m all every
one of m and how they are and what theyre doing and what they told
you to tell me and every last thing you can think of 

well i see i was up a stump and up it good providence had stood by me
this fur all right but i was hard and tight aground now i see it
warnt a bit of use to try to go ahead id got to throw up my hand so
i says to myself heres another place where i got to resk the truth i
opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the
bed and says 

 here he comes stick your head down lower there thatll do you cant
be seen now dont you let on youre here ill play a joke on him 
children dont you say a word 

i see i was in a fix now but it warnt no use to worry there warnt
nothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from
under when the lightning struck 

i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then
the bed hid him mrs phelps she jumps for him and says 

 has he come 

 no says her husband 

 good ness gracious she says what in the warld can have become of
him 

 i cant imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me
dreadful uneasy 

 uneasy she says im ready to go distracted he must a come and
youve missed him along the road i know its so something tells me
so 

 why sally i couldnt miss him along the road you know that 

 but oh dear dear what will sis say he must a come you must a
missed him he 

 oh dont distress me any moren im already distressed i dont know
what in the world to make of it im at my wits end and i dont mind
acknowledging t im right down scared but theres no hope that hes
come for he couldnt come and me miss him sally its terrible just
terrible somethings happened to the boat sure 

 why silas look yonder up the road aint that somebody coming 

he sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give mrs phelps
the chance she wanted she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and
give me a pull and out i come and when he turned back from the window
there she stood a beaming and a smiling like a house afire and i
standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside the old gentleman stared and
says 

 why whos that 

 who do you reckon t is 

 i haint no idea who is it 

 its tom sawyer 

by jings i most slumped through the floor but there warnt no time to
swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on
shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
cry and then how they both did fire off questions about sid and mary 
and the rest of the tribe 

but if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what i was for it was like
being born again i was so glad to find out who i was well they froze
to me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldnt
hardly go any more i had told them more about my family i mean the
sawyer family than ever happened to any six sawyer families and i
explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder head at the mouth of
white river and it took us three days to fix it which was all right 
and worked first rate because they didnt know but what it would take
three days to fix it if id a called it a bolthead it would a done just
as well 

now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty
uncomfortable all up the other being tom sawyer was easy and
comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a
steamboat coughing along down the river then i says to myself spose
tom sawyer comes down on that boat and spose he steps in here any
minute and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep
quiet 

well i couldnt have it that way it wouldnt do at all i must go up
the road and waylay him so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to
the town and fetch down my baggage the old gentleman was for going
along with me but i said no i could drive the horse myself and i
druther he wouldnt take no trouble about me 




chapter xxxiii 

so i started for town in the wagon and when i was half way i see a wagon
coming and sure enough it was tom sawyer and i stopped and waited till
he come along i says hold on and it stopped alongside and his mouth
opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three
times like a person thats got a dry throat and then says 

 i haint ever done you no harm you know that so then what you want
to come back and hant me for 

i says 

 i haint come back i haint been gone 

when he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warnt quite
satisfied yet he says 

 dont you play nothing on me because i wouldnt on you honest injun
now you aint a ghost 

 honest injun i aint i says 

 well i i well that ought to settle it of course but i cant
somehow seem to understand it no way looky here warnt you ever
murdered at all 

 no i warnt ever murdered at all i played it on them you come in
here and feel of me if you dont believe me 

so he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again
he didnt know what to do and he wanted to know all about it right off 
because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where
he lived but i said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver
to wait and we drove off a little piece and i told him the kind of a
fix i was in and what did he reckon we better do he said let him
alone a minute and dont disturb him so he thought and thought and
pretty soon he says 

 its all right ive got it take my trunk in your wagon and let on
its yourn and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the
house about the time you ought to and ill go towards town a piece and
take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you 
and you neednt let on to know me at first 

i says 

 all right but wait a minute theres one more thing a thing that
nobody dont know but me and that is theres a nigger here that im
a trying to steal out of slavery and his name is jim old miss watsons
jim 

he says 

 what why jim is 

he stopped and went to studying i says 

 i know what youll say youll say its dirty low down business but
what if it is im low down and im a going to steal him and i want
you keep mum and not let on will you 

his eye lit up and he says 

 ill help you steal him 

well i let go all holts then like i was shot it was the most
astonishing speech i ever heard and im bound to say tom sawyer fell
considerable in my estimation only i couldnt believe it tom sawyer a
nigger stealer 

 oh shucks i says youre joking 

 i aint joking either 

 well then i says joking or no joking if you hear anything said
about a runaway nigger dont forget to remember that you dont know
nothing about him and i dont know nothing about him 

then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way
and i drove mine but of course i forgot all about driving slow on
accounts of being glad and full of thinking so i got home a heap too
quick for that length of a trip the old gentleman was at the door and
he says 

 why this is wonderful whoever would a thought it was in that mare to
do it i wish wed a timed her and she haint sweated a hair not a
hair its wonderful why i wouldnt take a hundred dollars for that
horse now i wouldnt honest and yet id a sold her for fifteen
before and thought twas all she was worth 

thats all he said he was the innocentest best old soul i ever see 
but it warnt surprising because he warnt only just a farmer he was a
preacher too and had a little one horse log church down back of the
plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church
and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was
worth it too there was plenty other farmer preachers like that and
done the same way down south 

in about half an hour toms wagon drove up to the front stile and aunt
sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty
yards and says 

 why theres somebody come i wonder who tis why i do believe its
a stranger jimmy thats one of the children run and tell lize to
put on another plate for dinner 

everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger
dont come every year and so he lays over the yaller fever for
interest when he does come tom was over the stile and starting for the
house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all
bunched in the front door tom had his store clothes on and an
audience and that was always nuts for tom sawyer in them circumstances
it warnt no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable he warnt a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no 
he come cam and important like the ram when he got a front of us he
lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box
that had butterflies asleep in it and he didnt want to disturb them and
says 

 mr archibald nichols i presume 

 no my boy says the old gentleman im sorry to say t your driver
has deceived you nicholss place is down a matter of three mile more 
come in come in 

tom he took a look back over his shoulder and says too late hes out
of sight 

 yes hes gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with
us and then well hitch up and take you down to nicholss 

 oh i cant make you so much trouble i couldnt think of it ill walk
 i dont mind the distance 

 but we wont let you walk it wouldnt be southern hospitality to do it 
come right in 

 oh do says aunt sally it aint a bit of trouble to us not a bit in
the world you must stay its a long dusty three mile and we cant
let you walk and besides ive already told em to put on another
plate when i see you coming so you mustnt disappoint us come right in
and make yourself at home 

so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be
persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from
hicksville ohio and his name was william thompson and he made another
bow 

well he run on and on and on making up stuff about hicksville and
everybody in it he could invent and i getting a little nervious and
wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last 
still talking along he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the
mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was
going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her
hand and says 

 you owdacious puppy 

he looked kind of hurt and says 

 im surprised at you mam 

 youre srp why what do you reckon i am ive a good notion to take
and say what do you mean by kissing me 

he looked kind of humble and says 

 i didnt mean nothing mam i didnt mean no harm i i thought
youd like it 

 why you born fool she took up the spinning stick and it looked like
it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it what
made you think id like it 

 well i dont know only they they told me you would 

 they told you i would whoever told yous another lunatic i never
heard the beat of it whos they 

 why everybody they all said so mam 

it was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and her fingers
worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says 

 whos everybody out with their names or therll be an idiot short 

he got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says 

 im sorry and i warnt expecting it they told me to they all told
me to they all said kiss her and said shed like it they all said
it every one of them but im sorry mam and i wont do it no more
 i wont honest 

 you wont wont you well i shd reckon you wont 

 nom im honest about it i wont ever do it again till you ask me 

 till i ask you well i never see the beat of it in my born days i
lay youll be the methusalem numskull of creation before ever i ask you
 or the likes of you 

 well he says it does surprise me so i cant make it out somehow 
they said you would and i thought you would but he stopped and
looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye
somewheres and fetched up on the old gentlemans and says didnt you
think shed like me to kiss her sir 

 why no i i well no i blieve i didnt 

then he looks on around the same way to me and says 

 tom didnt you think aunt sally d open out her arms and say sid
sawyer 

 my land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young
rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but he fended her
off and says 

 no not till youve asked me first 

so she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him
over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took
what was left and after they got a little quiet again she says 

 why dear me i never see such a surprise we warnt looking for you at
all but only tom sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him 

 its because it warnt intended for any of us to come but tom he says 
 but i begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too 
so coming down the river me and tom thought it would be a first rate
surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by
tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger but it was a
mistake aunt sally this aint no healthy place for a stranger to
come 

 no not impudent whelps sid you ought to had your jaws boxed i
haint been so put out since i dont know when but i dont care i
dont mind the terms id be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to
have you here well to think of that performance i dont deny it i
was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack 

we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the
kitchen and there was things enough on that table for seven families
 and all hot too none of your flabby tough meat thats laid in a
cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold
cannibal in the morning uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing
over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bit neither the
way ive seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times there was a
considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and tom was on
the lookout all the time but it warnt no use they didnt happen to say
nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to
it but at supper at night one of the little boys says 

 pa maynt tom and sid and me go to the show 

 no says the old man i reckon there aint going to be any and you
couldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told burton and me
all about that scandalous show and burton said he would tell the people 
so i reckon theyve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this
time 

so there it was but i couldnt help it tom and me was to sleep in the
same room and bed so being tired we bid good night and went up to bed
right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the
lightning rod and shoved for the town for i didnt believe anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didnt hurry up
and give them one theyd get into trouble sure 

on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered 
and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more and
what a stir there was when jim run away and i told tom all about our
royal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as i had
time to and as we struck into the town and up through the middle of
it it was as much as half after eight then here comes a raging rush of
people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tin
pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go by and
as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a
rail that is i knowed it was the king and the duke though they was
all over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing in the world
that was human just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier 
plumes well it made me sick to see it and i was sorry for them poor
pitiful rascals it seemed like i couldnt ever feel any hardness
against them any more in the world it was a dreadful thing to see 
human beings can be awful cruel to one another 

we see we was too late couldnt do no good we asked some stragglers
about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent 
and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of
his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house
rose up and went for them 

so we poked along back home and i warnt feeling so brash as i was
before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehow though i
hadnt done nothing but thats always the way it dont make no
difference whether you do right or wrong a persons conscience aint got
no sense and just goes for him anyway if i had a yaller dog that
didnt know no more than a persons conscience does i would pison him 
it takes up more room than all the rest of a persons insides and yet
aint no good nohow tom sawyer he says the same 




chapter xxxiv 

we stopped talking and got to thinking by and by tom says 

 looky here huck what fools we are to not think of it before i bet i
know where jim is 

 no where 

 in that hut down by the ash hopper why looky here when we was at
dinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles 

 yes 

 what did you think the vittles was for 

 for a dog 

 so d i well it wasnt for a dog 

 why 

 because part of it was watermelon 

 so it was i noticed it well it does beat all that i never thought
about a dog not eating watermelon it shows how a body can see and dont
see at the same time 

 well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it
again when he came out he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from table same key i bet watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner 
and it aint likely theres two prisoners on such a little plantation 
and where the peoples all so kind and good jims the prisoner all
right im glad we found it out detective fashion i wouldnt give
shucks for any other way now you work your mind and study out a plan
to steal jim and i will study out one too and well take the one we
like the best 

what a head for just a boy to have if i had tom sawyers head i
wouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in
a circus nor nothing i can think of i went to thinking out a plan but
only just to be doing something i knowed very well where the right plan
was going to come from pretty soon tom says 

 ready 

 yes i says 

 all right bring it out 

 my plan is this i says we can easy find out if its jim in there 
then get up my canoe to morrow night and fetch my raft over from the
island then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old mans britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on
the raft with jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me and jim
used to do before wouldnt that plan work 

 work why certnly it would work like rats a fighting but its too
blame simple there aint nothing to it whats the good of a plan that
aint no more trouble than that its as mild as goose milk why huck 
it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory 

i never said nothing because i warnt expecting nothing different but i
knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldnt have
none of them objections to it 

and it didnt he told me what it was and i see in a minute it was
worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a man as
mine would and maybe get us all killed besides so i was satisfied and
said we would waltz in on it i neednt tell what it was here because i
knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was i knowed he would be changing
it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance and that is what he done 

well one thing was dead sure and that was that tom sawyer was in
earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery 
that was the thing that was too many for me here was a boy that was
respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at
home that had characters and he was bright and not leather headed and
knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was 
without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this
business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before
everybody i couldnt understand it no way at all it was outrageous 
and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true
friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself 
and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and says 

 dont you reckon i know what im about dont i generly know what im
about 

 yes 

 didnt i say i was going to help steal the nigger 

 yes 

 well then 

thats all he said and thats all i said it warnt no use to say any
more because when he said hed do a thing he always done it but i
couldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so i just let
it go and never bothered no more about it if he was bound to have it
so i couldnt help it 

when we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to
the hut by the ash hopper for to examine it we went through the yard so
as to see what the hounds would do they knowed us and didnt make no
more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in
the night when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the
two sides and on the side i warnt acquainted with which was the north
side we found a square window hole up tolerable high with just one
stout board nailed across it i says 

 heres the ticket this holes big enough for jim to get through if we
wrench off the board 

tom says 

 its as simple as tit tat toe three in a row and as easy as playing
hooky i should hope we can find a way thats a little more complicated
than that huck finn 

 well then i says how ll it do to saw him out the way i done
before i was murdered that time 

 thats more like he says its real mysterious and troublesome and
good he says but i bet we can find a way thats twice as long there
aint no hurry les keep on looking around 

betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a lean to that
joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank it was as long
as the hut but narrow only about six foot wide the door to it was at
the south end and was padlocked tom he went to the soap kettle and
searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with 
so he took it and prized out one of the staples the chain fell down 
and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and
see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connection with
it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old
rusty played out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow the
match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the
door was locked as good as ever tom was joyful he says 

 now were all right well dig him out it ll take about a week 

then we started for the house and i went in the back door you only have
to pull a buckskin latch string they dont fasten the doors but that
warnt romantical enough for tom sawyer no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightning rod but after he got up half way about three
times and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted
his brains out he thought hed got to give it up but after he was
rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time
he made the trip 

in the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jim if it was
jim that was being fed the niggers was just getting through breakfast
and starting for the fields and jims nigger was piling up a tin pan
with bread and meat and things and whilst the others was leaving the
key come from the house 

this nigger had a good natured chuckle headed face and his wool was all
tied up in little bunches with thread that was to keep witches off he
said the witches was pestering him awful these nights and making him see
all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and
noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched so long before in his
life he got so worked up and got to running on so about his troubles 
he forgot all about what hed been a going to do so tom says 

 whats the vittles for going to feed the dogs 

the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you
heave a brickbat in a mud puddle and he says 

 yes mars sid a dog curus dog too does you want to go en look at
im 

 yes 

i hunched tom and whispers 

 you going right here in the daybreak that warnt the plan 

 no it warnt but its the plan now 

so drat him we went along but i didnt like it much when we got in
we couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but jim was there sure
enough and could see us and he sings out 

 why huck en good lan ain dat misto tom 

i just knowed how it would be i just expected it i didnt know nothing
to do and if i had i couldnt a done it because that nigger busted in
and says 

 why de gracious sakes do he know you genlmen 

we could see pretty well now tom he looked at the nigger steady and
kind of wondering and says 

 does who know us 

 why dis yer runaway nigger 

 i dont reckon he does but what put that into your head 

 what put it dar didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowed you 

tom says in a puzzled up kind of way 

 well thats mighty curious who sung out when did he sing out what
did he sing out and turns to me perfectly cam and says did you
hear anybody sing out 

of course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so i says 

 no i aint heard nobody say nothing 

then he turns to jim and looks him over like he never see him before 
and says 

 did you sing out 

 no sah says jim i haint said nothing sah 

 not a word 

 no sah i haint said a word 

 did you ever see us before 

 no sah not as i knows on 

so tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and
says kind of severe 

 what do you reckons the matter with you anyway what made you think
somebody sung out 

 oh its de dad blame witches sah en i wisht i was dead i do deys
awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey skyers me so please to
dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole mars silas hell scole me kase
he say dey aint no witches i jis wish to goodness he was heah now
 den what would he say i jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun
it dis time but its awluz jis so people dats sot stays sot dey
wont look into nothnen fine it out fr deyselves en when you fine it
out en tell um bout it dey doan blieve you 

tom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him to
buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at jim and
says 

 i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger if i was to catch
a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away i wouldnt give him up 
id hang him and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the
dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to jim and says 

 dont ever let on to know us and if you hear any digging going on
nights its us were going to set you free 

jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger
come back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger wanted us
to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the
witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks
around then 




chapter xxxv 

it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down
into the woods because tom said we got to have some light to see how to
dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what
we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks thats called fox fire and
just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place we
fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and tom
says kind of dissatisfied 

 blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be 
and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan there
aint no watchman to be drugged now there ought to be a watchman there
aint even a dog to give a sleeping mixture to and theres jim chained
by one leg with a ten foot chain to the leg of his bed why all you
got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain and uncle
silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkin headed nigger and
dont send nobody to watch the nigger jim could a got out of that
window hole before this only there wouldnt be no use trying to travel
with a ten foot chain on his leg why drat it huck its the stupidest
arrangement i ever see you got to invent all the difficulties well we
cant help it we got to do the best we can with the materials weve got 
anyhow theres one thing theres more honor in getting him out
through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warnt one of them
furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and
you had to contrive them all out of your own head now look at just that
one thing of the lantern when you come down to the cold facts we
simply got to let on that a lanterns resky why we could work with a
torchlight procession if we wanted to i believe now whilst i think of
it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we
get 

 what do we want of a saw 

 what do we want of it haint we got to saw the leg of jims bed
off so as to get the chain loose 

 why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
off 

 well if that aint just like you huck finn you can get up the
infant schooliest ways of going at a thing why haint you ever read
any books at all baron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeny 
nor henri iv nor none of them heroes who ever heard of getting a
prisoner loose in such an old maidy way as that no the way all the
best authorities does is to saw the bed leg in two and leave it just so 
and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt and
grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant see no
sign of its being sawed and thinks the bed leg is perfectly sound 
then the night youre ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip
off your chain and there you are nothing to do but hitch your rope
ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moat
 because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you know and theres
your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you
across a saddle and away you go to your native langudoc or navarre or
wherever it is its gaudy huck i wish there was a moat to this cabin 
if we get time the night of the escape well dig one 

i says 

 what do we want of a moat when were going to snake him out from under
the cabin 

but he never heard me he had forgot me and everything else he had his
chin in his hand thinking pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head 
then sighs again and says 

 no it wouldnt do there aint necessity enough for it 

 for what i says 

 why to saw jims leg off he says 

 good land i says why there aint no necessity for it and what
would you want to saw his leg off for anyway 

 well some of the best authorities has done it they couldnt get the
chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved and a leg would
be better still but we got to let that go there aint necessity
enough in this case and besides jims a nigger and wouldnt
understand the reasons for it and how its the custom in europe so
well let it go but theres one thing he can have a rope ladder we
can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough and we
can send it to him in a pie its mostly done that way and ive et
worse pies 

 why tom sawyer how you talk i says jim aint got no use for a rope
ladder 

 he has got use for it how you talk you better say you dont know
nothing about it hes got to have a rope ladder they all do 

 what in the nation can he do with it 

 do with it he can hide it in his bed cant he thats what they all
do and hes got to too huck you dont ever seem to want to do
anything thats regular you want to be starting something fresh all the
time spose he dont do nothing with it aint it there in his bed for
a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon theyll want clews of
course they will and you wouldnt leave them any that would be a
pretty howdy do wouldnt it i never heard of such a thing 

 well i says if its in the regulations and hes got to have it all
right let him have it because i dont wish to go back on no
regulations but theres one thing tom sawyer if we go to tearing up
our sheets to make jim a rope ladder were going to get into trouble
with aunt sally just as sure as youre born now the way i look at it 
a hickry bark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothing and is
just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag
ladder you can start and as for jim he aint had no experience and so
he dont care what kind of a 

 oh shucks huck finn if i was as ignorant as you id keep still
 thats what id do who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a
hickry bark ladder why its perfectly ridiculous 

 well all right tom fix it your own way but if youll take my advice 
youll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline 

he said that would do and that gave him another idea and he says 

 borrow a shirt too 

 what do we want of a shirt tom 

 want it for jim to keep a journal on 

 journal your granny jim cant write 

 spose he cant write he can make marks on the shirt cant he if we
make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
barrel hoop 

 why tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better
one and quicker too 

 prisoners dont have geese running around the donjon keep to pull pens
out of you muggins they always make their pens out of the hardest 
toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like
that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeks and weeks and
months and months to file it out too because theyve got to do it by
rubbing it on the wall they wouldnt use a goose quill if they had it 
it aint regular 

 well then whatll we make him the ink out of 

 many makes it out of iron rust and tears but thats the common sort and
women the best authorities uses their own blood jim can do that and
when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to
let the world know where hes captivated he can write it on the bottom
of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window the iron mask
always done that and its a blame good way too 

 jim aint got no tin plates they feed him in a pan 

 that aint nothing we can get him some 

 cant nobody read his plates 

 that aint got anything to do with it huck finn all hes got to do is
to write on the plate and throw it out you dont have to be able to
read it why half the time you cant read anything a prisoner writes on
a tin plate or anywhere else 

 well then whats the sense in wasting the plates 

 why blame it all it aint the prisoners plates 

 but its somebodys plates aint it 

 well sposn it is what does the prisoner care whose 

he broke off there because we heard the breakfast horn blowing so we
cleared out for the house 

along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
clothes line and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went
down and got the fox fire and put that in too i called it borrowing 
because that was what pap always called it but tom said it warnt
borrowing it was stealing he said we was representing prisoners and
prisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody
dont blame them for it either it aint no crime in a prisoner to
steal the thing he needs to get away with tom said its his right and
so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
out of prison with he said if we warnt prisoners it would be a very
different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he
warnt a prisoner so we allowed we would steal everything there was
that come handy and yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that 
when i stole a watermelon out of the nigger patch and eat it and he made
me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for 
tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything we needed well 
i says i needed the watermelon but he said i didnt need it to get out
of prison with theres where the difference was he said if id a
wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal
with it would a been all right so i let it go at that though i
couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set
down and chaw over a lot of gold leaf distinctions like that every time i
see a chance to hog a watermelon 

well as i was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled
down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then tom he
carried the sack into the lean to whilst i stood off a piece to keep
watch by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile
to talk he says 

 everythings all right now except tools and thats easy fixed 

 tools i says 

 yes 

 tools for what 

 why to dig with we aint a going to gnaw him out are we 

 aint them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
nigger out with i says 

he turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says 

 huck finn did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and
all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with now
i want to ask you if you got any reasonableness in you at all what kind
of a show would that give him to be a hero why they might as well lend
him the key and done with it picks and shovels why they wouldnt
furnish em to a king 

 well then i says if we dont want the picks and shovels what do we
want 

 a couple of case knives 

 to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with 

 yes 

 confound it its foolish tom 

 it dont make no difference how foolish it is its the right way and
its the regular way and there aint no other way that ever i heard
of and ive read all the books that gives any information about these
things they always dig out with a case knife and not through dirt mind
you generly its through solid rock and it takes them weeks and weeks
and weeks and for ever and ever why look at one of them prisoners in
the bottom dungeon of the castle deef in the harbor of marseilles that
dug himself out that way how long was he at it you reckon 

 i dont know 

 well guess 

 i dont know a month and a half 

 thirty seven year and he come out in china thats the kind i wish
the bottom of this fortress was solid rock 

 jim dont know nobody in china 

 whats that got to do with it neither did that other fellow but
youre always a wandering off on a side issue why cant you stick to
the main point 

 all right i dont care where he comes out so he comes out and jim
dont either i reckon but theres one thing anyway jims too old to
be dug out with a case knife he wont last 

 yes he will last too you dont reckon its going to take thirty seven
years to dig out through a dirt foundation do you 

 how long will it take tom 

 well we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynt take
very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans hell
hear jim aint from there then his next move will be to advertise jim 
or something like that so we cant resk being as long digging him out
as we ought to by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years but
we cant things being so uncertain what i recommend is this that we
really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can let on 
to ourselves that we was at it thirty seven years then we can snatch
him out and rush him away the first time theres an alarm yes i reckon
that ll be the best way 

 now theres sense in that i says letting on dont cost nothing 
letting on aint no trouble and if its any object i dont mind letting
on we was at it a hundred and fifty year it wouldnt strain me none 
after i got my hand in so ill mosey along now and smouch a couple of
case knives 

 smouch three he says we want one to make a saw out of 

 tom if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it i says 
 theres an old rusty saw blade around yonder sticking under the
weather boarding behind the smoke house 

he looked kind of weary and discouraged like and says 

 it aint no use to try to learn you nothing huck run along and smouch
the knives three of them so i done it 




chapter xxxvi 

as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
lightning rod and shut ourselves up in the lean to and got out our pile
of fox fire and went to work we cleared everything out of the way 
about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log tom said he
was right behind jims bed now and wed dig in under it and when we got
through there couldnt nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole
there because jims counter pin hung down most to the ground and youd
have to raise it up and look under to see the hole so we dug and dug
with the case knives till most midnight and then we was dog tired and
our hands was blistered and yet you couldnt see wed done anything
hardly at last i says 

 this aint no thirty seven year job this is a thirty eight year job 
tom sawyer 

he never said nothing but he sighed and pretty soon he stopped
digging and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking 
then he says 

 it aint no use huck it aint a going to work if we was prisoners it
would because then wed have as many years as we wanted and no hurry 
and we wouldnt get but a few minutes to dig every day while they was
changing watches and so our hands wouldnt get blistered and we could
keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the
way it ought to be done but we cant fool along we got to rush we
aint got no time to spare if we was to put in another night this way
wed have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well couldnt
touch a case knife with them sooner 

 well then what we going to do tom 

 ill tell you it aint right and it aint moral and i wouldnt like
it to get out but there aint only just the one way we got to dig him
out with the picks and let on its case knives 

 now youre talking i says your head gets leveler and leveler all
the time tom sawyer i says picks is the thing moral or no moral 
and as for me i dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow when i
start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sunday school book i
aint no ways particular how its done so its done what i want is my
nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my
sunday school book and if a picks the handiest thing thats the thing
im a going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sunday school
book out with and i dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
about it nuther 

 well he says theres excuse for picks and letting on in a case like
this if it warnt so i wouldnt approve of it nor i wouldnt stand by
and see the rules broke because right is right and wrong is wrong and
a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant and knows
better it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick without any
letting on because you dont know no better but it wouldnt for me 
because i do know better gimme a case knife 

he had his own by him but i handed him mine he flung it down and
says 

 gimme a case knife 

i didnt know just what to do but then i thought i scratched around
amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took
it and went to work and never said a word 

he was always just that particular full of principle 

so then i got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and
made the fur fly we stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long
as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it 
when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his
level best with the lightning rod but he couldnt come it his hands was
so sore at last he says 

 it aint no use it cant be done what you reckon i better do cant
you think of no way 

 yes i says but i reckon it aint regular come up the stairs and
let on its a lightning rod 

so he done it 

next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house 
for to make some pens for jim out of and six tallow candles and i hung
around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tin
plates tom says it wasnt enough but i said nobody wouldnt ever see
the plates that jim throwed out because theyd fall in the dog fennel
and jimpson weeds under the window hole then we could tote them back and
he could use them over again so tom was satisfied then he says 

 now the thing to study out is how to get the things to jim 

 take them in through the hole i says when we get it done 

he only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard
of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying by and by he said
he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need to decide
on any of them yet said wed got to post jim first 

that night we went down the lightning rod a little after ten and took
one of the candles along and listened under the window hole and heard
jim snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him then we
whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a half
the job was done we crept in under jims bed and into the cabin and
pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over jim awhile 
and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle
and gradual he was so glad to see us he most cried and called us
honey and all the pet names he could think of and was for having us
hunt up a cold chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away 
and clearing out without losing any time but tom he showed him how
unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and
how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not
to be the least afraid because we would see he got away sure so jim
he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old times
awhile and then tom asked a lot of questions and when jim told him
uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him and aunt sally
come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of
them was kind as they could be tom says 

 now i know how to fix it well send you some things by them 

i said dont do nothing of the kind its one of the most jackass ideas
i ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went right on it
was his way when hed got his plans set 

so he told jim how wed have to smuggle in the rope ladder pie and other
large things by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the
lookout and not be surprised and not let nat see him open them and we
would put small things in uncles coat pockets and he must steal them
out and we would tie things to aunts apron strings or put them in her
apron pocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and
what they was for and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
his blood and all that he told him everything jim he couldnt see no
sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as
tom said 

jim had plenty corn cob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good
sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed 
with hands that looked like theyd been chawed tom was in high spirits 
he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most
intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep
it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out 
for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he
got used to it he said that in that way it could be strung out to as
much as eighty year and would be the best time on record and he said
it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it 

in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
candlestick into handy sizes and tom put them and the pewter spoon in
his pocket then we went to the nigger cabins and while i got nats
notice off tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
corn pone that was in jims pan and we went along with nat to see how it
would work and it just worked noble when jim bit into it it most mashed
all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a worked better 
tom said so himself jim he never let on but what it was only just a
piece of rock or something like that thats always getting into bread 
you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his
fork into it in three or four places first 

and whilst we was a standing there in the dimmish light here comes a
couple of the hounds bulging in from under jims bed and they kept on
piling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly room in
there to get your breath by jings we forgot to fasten that lean to
door the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once and keeled
over on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he was
dying tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jims meat and
the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back
again and shut the door and i knowed hed fixed the other door too 
then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and
asking him if hed been imagining he saw something again he raised up 
and blinked his eyes around and says 

 mars sid youll say is a fool but if i didnt blieve i see most a
million dogs er devils er somen i wisht i may die right heah in dese
tracks i did mos sholy mars sid i felt um i felt um sah dey was
all over me dad fetch it i jis wisht i could git my hans on one er
dem witches jis wunst ony jis wunst its all id ast but mosly i
wisht deyd lemme lone i does 

tom says 

 well i tell you what i think what makes them come here just at this
runaway niggers breakfast time its because theyre hungry thats the
reason you make them a witch pie thats the thing for you to do 

 but my lan mars sid hows i gwyne to make m a witch pie i doan

you handle the witch things 

 hannel m mars sid what is you a talkin bout i wouldn lay de
weight er my finger on um not fr ten hundd thousn billion dollars i
wouldnt 




chapter xxxvii 

that was all fixed so then we went away and went to the rubbage pile in
the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and pieces of
bottles and wore out tin things and all such truck and scratched
around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as
we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full
of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shingle nails
that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and
sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in aunt
sallys apron pocket which was hanging on a chair and tother we stuck
in the band of uncle silass hat which was on the bureau because we
heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway niggers
house this morning and then went to breakfast and tom dropped the
pewter spoon in uncle silass coat pocket and aunt sally wasnt come
yet so we had to wait a little while 

and when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardly wait
for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand
and cracking the handiest childs head with her thimble with the other 
and says 

 ive hunted high and ive hunted low and it does beat all what has
become of your other shirt 

my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hard
piece of corn crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the
children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing worm and let a cry
out of him the size of a warwhoop and tom he turned kinder blue around
the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for
about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and i would a sold out
for half price if there was a bidder but after that we was all right
again it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold 
uncle silas he says 

 its most uncommon curious i cant understand it i know perfectly
well i took it off because 

 because you haint got but one on just listen at the man i know you
took it off and know it by a better way than your wool gethering memory 
too because it was on the clos line yesterday i see it there myself 
but its gone thats the long and the short of it and youll just have
to change to a red flannl one till i can get time to make a new one 
and it ll be the third ive made in two years it just keeps a body on
the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to do with m
all is moren i can make out a body d think you would learn to take
some sort of care of em at your time of life 

 i know it sally and i do try all i can but it oughtnt to be
altogether my fault because you know i dont see them nor have nothing
to do with them except when theyre on me and i dont believe ive ever
lost one of them off of me 

 well it aint your fault if you havent silas youd a done it if you
could i reckon and the shirt aint all thats gone nuther thers a
spoon gone and that aint all there was ten and now thers only nine 
the calf got the shirt i reckon but the calf never took the spoon 
thats certain 

 why what else is gone sally 

 thers six candles gone thats what the rats could a got the candles 
and i reckon they did i wonder they dont walk off with the whole place 
the way youre always going to stop their holes and dont do it and if
they warnt fools theyd sleep in your hair silas youd never find it
out but you cant lay the spoon on the rats and that i know 

 well sally im in fault and i acknowledge it ive been remiss but i
wont let to morrow go by without stopping up them holes 

 oh i wouldnt hurry next year ll do matilda angelina araminta
phelps 

whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the
sugar bowl without fooling around any just then the nigger woman steps
on to the passage and says 

 missus deys a sheet gone 

 a sheet gone well for the lands sake 

 ill stop up them holes to day says uncle silas looking sorrowful 

 oh do shet up spose the rats took the sheet wheres it gone 
lize 

 clah to goodness i haint no notion miss sally she wuz on de
closline yistiddy but she done gone she ain dah no mo now 

 i reckon the world is coming to an end i never see the beat of it in
all my born days a shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can 

 missus comes a young yaller wench deys a brass cannelstick missn 

 cler out from here you hussy er ill take a skillet to ye 

well she was just a biling i begun to lay for a chance i reckoned i
would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated she
kept a raging right along running her insurrection all by herself and
everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last uncle silas looking
kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket she stopped 
with her mouth open and her hands up and as for me i wished i was in
jeruslem or somewheres but not long because she says 

 its just as i expected so you had it in your pocket all the time and
like as not youve got the other things there too howd it get there 

 i reely dont know sally he says kind of apologizing or you know i
would tell i was a studying over my text in acts seventeen before
breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not noticing meaning to put
my testament in and it must be so because my testament aint in but
ill go and see and if the testament is where i had it ill know i
didnt put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and
took up the spoon and 

 oh for the lands sake give a body a rest go long now the whole
kit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till ive got back my
peace of mind 

id a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alone speaking it out 
and id a got up and obeyed her if id a been dead as we was passing
through the setting room the old man he took up his hat and the
shingle nail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and
laid it on the mantel shelf and never said nothing and went out tom
see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says 

 well it aint no use to send things by him no more he aint reliable 
then he says but he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway 
without knowing it and so well go and do him one without him knowing
it stop up his rat holes 

there was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole
hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape then we heard
steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the
old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in tother 
looking as absent minded as year before last he went a mooning around 
first to one rat hole and then another till hed been to them all then
he stood about five minutes picking tallow drip off of his candle and
thinking then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying 

 well for the life of me i cant remember when i done it i could show
her now that i warnt to blame on account of the rats but never mind
 let it go i reckon it wouldnt do no good 

and so he went on a mumbling up stairs and then we left he was a
mighty nice old man and always is 

tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said
wed got to have it so he took a think when he had ciphered it out he
told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoon basket
till we see aunt sally coming and then tom went to counting the spoons
and laying them out to one side and i slid one of them up my sleeve and
tom says 

 why aunt sally there aint but nine spoons yet 

she says 

 go long to your play and dont bother me i know better i counted m
myself 

 well ive counted them twice aunty and i cant make but nine 

she looked out of all patience but of course she come to count anybody
would 

 i declare to gracious ther aint but nine she says why what in
the world plague take the things ill count m again 

so i slipped back the one i had and when she got done counting she
says 

 hang the troublesome rubbage thers ten now and she looked huffy and
bothered both but tom says 

 why aunty i dont think theres ten 

 you numskull didnt you see me count m 

 i know but 

 well ill count m again 

so i smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time well 
she was in a tearing way just a trembling all over she was so mad but
she counted and counted till she got that addled shed start to count in
the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times they come out
right and three times they come out wrong then she grabbed up the
basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley west 
and she said cler out and let her have some peace and if we come
bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skin us so we
had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apron pocket whilst she was
a giving us our sailing orders and jim got it all right along with her
shingle nail before noon we was very well satisfied with this
business and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because
he said now she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alike again to save
her life and wouldnt believe shed counted them right if she did and
said that after shed about counted her head off for the next three days
he judged shed give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to
ever count them any more 

so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her
closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of
days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any more and she
didnt care and warnt a going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out
about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her life she druther
die first 

so we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and
the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed up
counting and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequence it would
blow over by and by 

but that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie we fixed
it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got it done at
last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to
use up three wash pans full of flour before we got through and we got
burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out with the smoke 
because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and we couldnt
prop it up right and she would always cave in but of course we thought
of the right way at last which was to cook the ladder too in the
pie so then we laid in with jim the second night and tore up the sheet
all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight
we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with we let on it
took nine months to make it 

and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldnt go into
the pie being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough
for forty pies if wed a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or
sausage or anything you choose we could a had a whole dinner 

but we didnt need it all we needed was just enough for the pie 
and so we throwed the rest away we didnt cook none of the pies in the
wash pan afraid the solder would melt but uncle silas he had a noble
brass warming pan which he thought considerable of because it belonged
to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from
england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early
ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things
that was valuable not on account of being any account because they
warnt but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her
out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies 
because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the last one we
took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her
up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put
hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool
and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a
satisfaction to look at but the person that et it would want to fetch a
couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldnt
cramp him down to business i dont know nothing what im talking about 
and lay him in enough stomach ache to last him till next time too 

nat didnt look when we put the witch pie in jims pan and we put the
three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so jim
got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into
the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched
some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window hole 




chapter xxxviii 

making them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jim
allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all thats the
one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall but he had to have
it tom said hed got to there warnt no case of a state prisoner not
scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arms 

 look at lady jane grey he says look at gilford dudley look at old
northumberland why huck spose it is considerble trouble what you
going to do how you going to get around it jims got to do his
inscription and coat of arms they all do 

jim says 

 why mars tom i haint got no coat o arm i haint got nuffn but dish
yer ole shirt en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat 

 oh you dont understand jim a coat of arms is very different 

 well i says jims right anyway when he says he aint got no coat
of arms because he haint 

 i reckon i knowed that tom says but you bet hell have one before he
goes out of this because hes going out right and there aint going to
be no flaws in his record 

so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece jim
a making hisn out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon tom
set to work to think out the coat of arms by and by he said hed struck
so many good ones he didnt hardly know which to take but there was one
which he reckoned hed decide on he says 

 on the scutcheon well have a bend or in the dexter base a saltire
murrey in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under
his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron vert in a chief
engrailed and three invected lines on a field azure with the nombril
points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger sable 
with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of
gules for supporters which is you and me motto maggiore fretta minore
otto got it out of a book means the more haste the less speed 

 geewhillikins i says but what does the rest of it mean 

 we aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig in
like all git out 

 well anyway i says whats some of it whats a fess 

 a fess a fess is you dont need to know what a fess is ill show him
how to make it when he gets to it 

 shucks tom i says i think you might tell a person whats a bar
sinister 

 oh i dont know but hes got to have it all the nobility does 

that was just his way if it didnt suit him to explain a thing to you 
he wouldnt do it you might pump at him a week it wouldnt make no
difference 

hed got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in to
finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a
mournful inscription said jim got to have one like they all done he
made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so 

 here a captive heart busted here a poor prisoner forsook by the
world and friends fretted his sorrowful life here a lonely heart
broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirty seven years of
solitary captivity here homeless and friendless after thirty seven
years of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of
louis xiv 

toms voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down 
when he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for jim to
scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he
would let him scrabble them all on jim said it would take him a year to
scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and he didnt
know how to make letters besides but tom said he would block them out
for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but just follow the
lines then pretty soon he says 

 come to think the logs aint a going to do they dont have log walls
in a dungeon we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock well fetch a
rock 

jim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take him such
a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out but
tom said he would let me help him do it then he took a look to see how
me and jim was getting along with the pens it was most pesky tedious
hard work and slow and didnt give my hands no show to get well of the
sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so tom says 

 i know how to fix it we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock 
theres a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and well smouch it and
carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too 

it warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstone
nuther but we allowed wed tackle it it warnt quite midnight yet so
we cleared out for the mill leaving jim at work we smouched the
grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough
job sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from falling over 
and she come mighty near mashing us every time tom said she was going
to get one of us sure before we got through we got her half way and
then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat we see it
warnt no use we got to go and fetch jim so he raised up his bed and
slid the chain off of the bed leg and wrapt it round and round his neck 
and we crawled out through our hole and down there and jim and me laid
into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and tom
superintended he could out superintend any boy i ever see he knowed
how to do everything 

our hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstone
through but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough then tom
marked out them things on it with the nail and set jim to work on them 
with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
lean to for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle
quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under
his straw tick and sleep on it then we helped him fix his chain back on
the bed leg and was ready for bed ourselves but tom thought of
something and says 

 you got any spiders in here jim 

 no sah thanks to goodness i haint mars tom 

 all right well get you some 

 but bless you honey i doan want none is afeard un um i jis s
soon have rattlesnakes aroun 

tom thought a minute or two and says 

 its a good idea and i reckon its been done it must a been done it
stands to reason yes its a prime good idea where could you keep
it 

 keep what mars tom 

 why a rattlesnake 

 de goodness gracious alive mars tom why if dey was a rattlesnake to
come in heah id take en bust right out thoo dat log wall i would wid
my head 

 why jim you wouldnt be afraid of it after a little you could tame
it 

 tame it 

 yes easy enough every animal is grateful for kindness and petting 
and they wouldnt think of hurting a person that pets them any book
will tell you that you try thats all i ask just try for two or three
days why you can get him so in a little while that hell love you and
sleep with you and wont stay away from you a minute and will let you

 please mars tom doan talk so i cant stan it hed let me shove
his head in my mouf fer a favor haint it i lay hed wait a powful
long time fo i ast him en mo en dat i doan want him to sleep wid
me 

 jim dont act so foolish a prisoners got to have some kind of a dumb
pet and if a rattlesnake haint ever been tried why theres more glory
to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way
you could ever think of to save your life 

 why mars tom i doan want no sich glory snake take n bite jims
chin off den whah is de glory no sah i doan want no sich doins 

 blame it cant you try i only want you to try you neednt keep it up
if it dont work 

 but de trouble all done ef de snake bite me while is a tryin him 
mars tom is willin to tackle mos anything at aint onreasonable but
ef you en huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame is gwyne to
leave dats shore 

 well then let it go let it go if youre so bull headed about it we

tails and let on theyre rattlesnakes and i reckon that ll have to
do 

 i kn stan dem mars tom but blame f i couldn get along widout um

sturb a body en rustle roun over im en bite his feet when hes
tryin to sleep i ever see no sah gimme gyarter snakes f is got
to have m but doan gimme no rats i hain got no use fr um skasely 

 but jim you got to have em they all do so dont make no more fuss
about it prisoners aint ever without rats there aint no instance of
it and they train them and pet them and learn them tricks and they
get to be as sociable as flies but you got to play music to them you
got anything to play music on 

 i ain got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o paper en a juice harp 
but i reckn dey wouldn take no stock in a juice harp 

 yes they would they dont care what kind of music tis a jews harps
plenty good enough for a rat all animals like music in a prison they
dote on it specially painful music and you cant get no other kind
out of a jews harp it always interests them they come out to see
whats the matter with you yes youre all right youre fixed very
well you want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep and
early in the mornings and play your jews harp play the last link is
broken thats the thing that ll scoop a rat quicker n anything else 
and when youve played about two minutes youll see all the rats and the
snakes and spiders and things begin to feel worried about you and
come and theyll just fairly swarm over you and have a noble good
time 

 yes dey will i reckn mars tom but what kine er time is jim havin 
blest if i kin see de pint but ill do it ef i got to i reckn i
better keep de animals satisfied en not have no trouble in de house 

tom waited to think it over and see if there wasnt nothing else and
pretty soon he says 

 oh theres one thing i forgot could you raise a flower here do you
reckon 

 i doan know but maybe i could mars tom but its tolable dark in heah 
en i ain got no use fr no flower nohow en shed be a powful sight o
trouble 

 well you try it anyway some other prisoners has done it 

 one er dem big cat tail lookin mullen stalks would grow in heah mars
tom i reckn but she wouldnt be wuth half de trouble shed coss 

 dont you believe it well fetch you a little one and you plant it in
the corner over there and raise it and dont call it mullen call it
pitchiola thats its right name when its in a prison and you want to
water it with your tears 

 why i got plenty spring water mars tom 

 you dont want spring water you want to water it with your tears its
the way they always do 

 why mars tom i lay i kin raise one er dem mullen stalks twyste wid
spring water whiles another mans a startn one wid tears 

 that aint the idea you got to do it with tears 

 shell die on my hans mars tom she sholy will kase i doan skasely
ever cry 

so tom was stumped but he studied it over and then said jim would have
to worry along the best he could with an onion he promised he would go
to the nigger cabins and drop one private in jims coffee pot in the
morning jim said he would jis s soon have tobacker in his coffee 
and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising
the mullen and jews harping the rats and petting and flattering up the
snakes and spiders and things on top of all the other work he had to do
on pens and inscriptions and journals and things which made it more
trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he
ever undertook that tom most lost all patience with him and said he was
just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in
the world to make a name for himself and yet he didnt know enough to
appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him so jim he was
sorry and said he wouldnt behave so no more and then me and tom shoved
for bed 




chapter xxxix 

in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat trap and
fetched it down and unstopped the best rat hole and in about an hour we
had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and put it
in a safe place under aunt sallys bed but while we was gone for
spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found
it there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out 
and they did and aunt sally she come in and when we got back she was
a standing on top of the bed raising cain and the rats was doing what
they could to keep off the dull times for her so she took and dusted us
both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catching another
fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warnt the
likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock 
i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was 

we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and
caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornets
nest but we didnt the family was at home we didnt give it right
up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed wed
tire them out or theyd got to tire us out and they done it then we
got allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all right
again but couldnt set down convenient and so we went for the snakes 
and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house snakes and put them in a
bag and put it in our room and by that time it was supper time and a
rattling good honest days work and hungry oh no i reckon not and
there warnt a blessed snake up there when we went back we didnt half
tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left but it didnt
matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres so we
judged we could get some of them again no there warnt no real
scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell youd see
them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and they
generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of
the time where you didnt want them well they was handsome and
striped and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that never
made no difference to aunt sally she despised snakes be the breed what
they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it and
every time one of them flopped down on her it didnt make no difference
what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out i
never see such a woman and you could hear her whoop to jericho you
couldnt get her to take a holt of one of them with the tongs and if
she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
howl that you would think the house was afire she disturbed the old man
so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snakes
created why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
house for as much as a week aunt sally warnt over it yet she warnt
near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could
touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right
out of her stockings it was very curious but tom said all women was
just so he said they was made that way for some reason or other 

we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and she
allowed these lickings warnt nothing to what she would do if we ever
loaded up the place again with them i didnt mind the lickings because
they didnt amount to nothing but i minded the trouble we had to lay in
another lot but we got them laid in and all the other things and you
never see a cabin as blithesome as jims was when theyd all swarm out
for music and go for him jim didnt like the spiders and the spiders
didnt like jim and so theyd lay for him and make it mighty warm for
him and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone
there warnt no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body
couldnt sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said 
because they never all slept at one time but took turn about so when
the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck and when the rats turned in
the snakes come on watch so he always had one gang under him in his
way and tother gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt
a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over 
he said if he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a prisoner
again not for a salary 

well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape the
shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit jim he would
get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the
pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
grindstone the bed leg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust 
and it give us a most amazing stomach ache we reckoned we was all going
to die but didnt it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see and
tom said the same but as i was saying wed got all the work done now 
at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly jim the
old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to
come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because
there warnt no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise jim in
the st louis and new orleans papers and when he mentioned the st louis
ones it give me the cold shivers and i see we hadnt no time to lose 
so tom said now for the nonnamous letters 

 whats them i says 

 warnings to the people that something is up sometimes its done one
way sometimes another but theres always somebody spying around that
gives notice to the governor of the castle when louis xvi was going to
light out of the tooleries a servant girl done it its a very good way 
and so is the nonnamous letters well use them both and its usual
for the prisoners mother to change clothes with him and she stays in 
and he slides out in her clothes well do that too 

 but looky here tom what do we want to warn anybody for that
somethings up let them find it out for themselves its their
lookout 

 yes i know but you cant depend on them its the way theyve acted
from the very start left us to do everything theyre so confiding and
mullet headed they dont take notice of nothing at all so if we dont
give them notice there wont be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us 
and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll go off
perfectly flat wont amount to nothing wont be nothing to it 

 well as for me tom thats the way id like 

 shucks he says and looked disgusted so i says 

 but i aint going to make no complaint any way that suits you suits
me what you going to do about the servant girl 

 youll be her you slide in in the middle of the night and hook that
yaller girls frock 

 why tom that ll make trouble next morning because of course she
probbly haint got any but that one 

 i know but you dont want it but fifteen minutes to carry the
nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door 

 all right then ill do it but i could carry it just as handy in my
own togs 

 you wouldnt look like a servant girl then would you 

 no but there wont be nobody to see what i look like anyway 

 that aint got nothing to do with it the thing for us to do is just to
do our duty and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not 
haint you got no principle at all 

 all right i aint saying nothing im the servant girl whos jims
mother 

 im his mother ill hook a gown from aunt sally 

 well then youll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves 

 not much ill stuff jims clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
to represent his mother in disguise and jim ll take the nigger womans
gown off of me and wear it and well all evade together when a
prisoner of style escapes its called an evasion its always called so
when a king escapes frinstance and the same with a kings son it
dont make no difference whether hes a natural one or an unnatural one 

so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and i smouched the yaller wenchs
frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the
way tom told me to it said 

beware trouble is brewing keep a sharp lookout unknown friend 

next night we stuck a picture which tom drawed in blood of a skull and
crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on
the back door i never see a family in such a sweat they couldnt a
been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air if a
door banged aunt sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell she
jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when she warnt
noticing she done the same she couldnt face noway and be satisfied 
because she allowed there was something behind her every time so she was
always a whirling around sudden and saying ouch and before shed got
two thirds around shed whirl back again and say it again and she was
afraid to go to bed but she dasnt set up so the thing was working
very well tom said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory 
he said it showed it was done right 

so he said now for the grand bulge so the very next morning at the
streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we
better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to
have a nigger on watch at both doors all night tom he went down the
lightning rod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep 
and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back this letter said 

dont betray me i wish to be your friend there is a desprate gang of
cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway
nigger to night and they have been trying to scare you so as you will
stay in the house and not bother them i am one of the gang but have
got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will
betray the helish design they will sneak down from northards along the
fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the niggers cabin
to get him i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any
danger but stead of that i will ba like a sheep soon as they get in and
not blow at all then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip
there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure dont do
anything but just the way i am telling you if you do they will suspicion
something and raise whoop jamboreehoo i do not wish any reward but to
know i have done the right thing unknown friend 




chapter xl 

we was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went
over the river a fishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a
look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper 
and found them in such a sweat and worry they didnt know which end they
was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
supper and wouldnt tell us what the trouble was and never let on a
word about the new letter but didnt need to because we knowed as much
about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her
back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about
half past eleven and tom put on aunt sallys dress that he stole and
was going to start with the lunch but says 

 wheres the butter 

 i laid out a hunk of it i says on a piece of a corn pone 

 well you left it laid out then it aint here 

 we can get along without it i says 

 we can get along with it too he says just you slide down cellar and
fetch it and then mosey right down the lightning rod and come along 
ill go and stuff the straw into jims clothes to represent his mother in
disguise and be ready to ba like a sheep and shove soon as you get
there 

so out he went and down cellar went i the hunk of butter big as a
persons fist was where i had left it so i took up the slab of
corn pone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very
stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes aunt
sally with a candle and i clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my
hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says 

 you been down cellar 

 yesm 

 what you been doing down there 

 nothn 

 nothn 

 nom 

 well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night 

 i dont know m 

 you dont know dont answer me that way tom i want to know what you
been doing down there 

 i haint been doing a single thing aunt sally i hope to gracious if i
have 

i reckoned shed let me go now and as a generl thing she would but i
spose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
about every little thing that warnt yard stick straight so she says 
very decided 

 you just march into that setting room and stay there till i come you
been up to something you no business to and i lay ill find out what it
is before im done with you 

so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the setting room 
my but there was a crowd there fifteen farmers and every one of them
had a gun i was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down 
they was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice 
and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warnt 
but i knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and
putting them on and scratching their heads and changing their seats 
and fumbling with their buttons i warnt easy myself but i didnt take
my hat off all the same 

i did wish aunt sally would come and get done with me and lick me if
she wanted to and let me get away and tell tom how wed overdone this
thing and what a thundering hornets nest wed got ourselves into so we
could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with jim before
these rips got out of patience and come for us 

at last she come and begun to ask me questions but i couldnt answer
them straight i didnt know which end of me was up because these men
was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay
for them desperadoes and saying it warnt but a few minutes to midnight 
and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
sheep signal and here was aunty pegging away at the questions and me
a shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared 
and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt
and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of
them says im for going and getting in the cabin first and right now 
and catching them when they come i most dropped and a streak of butter
come a trickling down my forehead and aunt sally she see it and turns
white as a sheet and says 

 for the lands sake what is the matter with the child hes got the
brain fever as shore as youre born and theyre oozing out 

and everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the
bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me 
and says 

 oh what a turn you did give me and how glad and grateful i am it aint
no worse for lucks against us and it never rains but it pours and
when i see that truck i thought wed lost you for i knowed by the color
and all it was just like your brains would be if dear dear whydnt you
tell me that was what youd been down there for i wouldnt a cared now
cler out to bed and dont lemme see no more of you till morning 

i was up stairs in a second and down the lightning rod in another one 
and shinning through the dark for the lean to i couldnt hardly get my
words out i was so anxious but i told tom as quick as i could we must
jump for it now and not a minute to lose the house full of men yonder 
with guns 

his eyes just blazed and he says 

 no is that so aint it bully why huck if it was to do over
again i bet i could fetch two hundred if we could put it off till 

 hurry hurry i says wheres jim 

 right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him hes
dressed and everythings ready now well slide out and give the
sheep signal 

but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard them
begin to fumble with the pad lock and heard a man say 

 i told you wed be too soon they havent come the door is locked 
here ill lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in the
dark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece 
and listen if you can hear em coming 

so in they come but couldnt see us in the dark and most trod on us
whilst we was hustling to get under the bed but we got under all right 
and out through the hole swift but soft jim first me next and tom
last which was according to toms orders now we was in the lean to 
and heard trampings close by outside so we crept to the door and tom
stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt make out
nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the
steps to get further and when he nudged us jim must glide out first and
him last so he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and
listened and the steps a scraping around out there all the time and at
last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and
not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in
injun file and got to it all right and me and jim over it but toms
britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the
steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and
made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings
out 

 whos that answer or ill shoot 

but we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved then there
was a rush and a bang bang bang and the bullets fairly whizzed around
us we heard them sing out 

 here they are theyve broke for the river after em boys and turn
loose the dogs 

so here they come full tilt we could hear them because they wore boots
and yelled but we didnt wear no boots and didnt yell we was in the
path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into
the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them theyd had
all the dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare off the robbers but by this
time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow
enough for a million but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks
till they catched up and when they see it warnt nobody but us and no
excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead
towards the shouting and clattering and then we up steam again and
whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck
up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled
for dear life towards the middle of the river but didnt make no more
noise than we was obleeged to then we struck out easy and comfortable 
for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and
barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away
the sounds got dim and died out and when we stepped on to the raft i
says 

 now old jim youre a free man again and i bet you wont ever be a
slave no more 

 en a mighty good job it wuz too huck it uz planned beautiful en it
uz done beautiful en dey aint nobody kin git up a plan dats mo
mixed up en splendid den what dat one wuz 

we was all glad as we could be but tom was the gladdest of all because
he had a bullet in the calf of his leg 

when me and jim heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we did before 
it was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the
wigwam and tore up one of the dukes shirts for to bandage him but he
says 

 gimme the rags i can do it myself dont stop now dont fool around
here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set
her loose boys we done it elegant deed we did i wish wed a had
the handling of louis xvi there wouldnt a been no son of saint louis 
ascend to heaven wrote down in his biography no sir wed a whooped
him over the border thats what wed a done with him and done it just
as slick as nothing at all too man the sweeps man the sweeps 

but me and jim was consulting and thinking and after wed thought a
minute i says 

 say it jim 

so he says 

 well den dis is de way it look to me huck ef it wuz him dat uz
bein sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say go on
en save me nemmine bout a doctor fr to save dis one is dat like
mars tom sawyer would he say dat you bet he wouldnt well den is
jim gywne to say it no sah i doan budge a step outn dis place dout
a doctor not if its forty year 

i knowed he was white inside and i reckoned hed say what he did say so
it was all right now and i told tom i was a going for a doctor he
raised considerable row about it but me and jim stuck to it and wouldnt
budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but
we wouldnt let him then he give us a piece of his mind but it didnt
do no good 

so when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says 

 well then if youre bound to go ill tell you the way to do when you
get to the village shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full
of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back
alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe 
in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and take his
chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get him back
to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again 
its the way they all do 

so i said i would and left and jim was to hide in the woods when he see
the doctor coming till he was gone again 




chapter xli 

the doctor was an old man a very nice kind looking old man when i got
him up i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting
yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about
midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot
him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say
nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home
this evening and surprise the folks 

 who is your folks he says 

 the phelpses down yonder 

 oh he says and after a minute he says 

 howd you say he got shot 

 he had a dream i says and it shot him 

 singular dream he says 

so he lit up his lantern and got his saddle bags and we started but
when he sees the canoe he didnt like the look of her said she was big
enough for one but didnt look pretty safe for two i says 

 oh you neednt be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy
enough 

 what three 

 why me and sid and and and the guns thats what i mean 

 oh he says 

but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and
said he reckoned hed look around for a bigger one but they was all
locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he
come back or i could hunt around further or maybe i better go down home
and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to but i said i didnt 
so i told him just how to find the raft and then he started 

i struck an idea pretty soon i says to myself sposn he cant fix that
leg just in three shakes of a sheeps tail as the saying is sposn it
takes him three or four days what are we going to do lay around there
till he lets the cat out of the bag no sir i know what ill do ill
wait and when he comes back if he says hes got to go any more ill get
down there too if i swim and well take and tie him and keep him and
shove out down the river and when toms done with him well give him
what its worth or all we got and then let him get ashore 

so then i crept into a lumber pile to get some sleep and next time i
waked up the sun was away up over my head i shot out and went for the
doctors house but they told me hed gone away in the night some time or
other and warnt back yet well thinks i that looks powerful bad for
tom and ill dig out for the island right off so away i shoved and
turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into uncle silass stomach 
he says 

 why tom where you been all this time you rascal 

 i haint been nowheres i says only just hunting for the runaway
nigger me and sid 

 why where ever did you go he says your aunts been mighty uneasy 

 she neednt i says because we was all right we followed the men
and the dogs but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we
heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and
crossed over but couldnt find nothing of them so we cruised along
up shore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe
and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we
paddled over here to hear the news and sids at the post office to see
what he can hear and im a branching out to get something to eat for us 
and then were going home 

so then we went to the post office to get sid but just as i
suspicioned he warnt there so the old man he got a letter out of the
office and we waited awhile longer but sid didnt come so the old man
said come along let sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done
fooling around but we would ride i couldnt get him to let me stay and
wait for sid and he said there warnt no use in it and i must come
along and let aunt sally see we was all right 

when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried
both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that dont
amount to shucks and said shed serve sid the same when he come 

and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers wives to dinner and
such another clack a body never heard old mrs hotchkiss was the worst 
her tongue was a going all the time she says

sheet they made the rag ladder out of ther aint no telling how many
times they didnt steal that and flour and candles and candlesticks 
and spoons and the old warming pan and most a thousand things that i
disremember now and my new calico dress and me and silas and my sid and
tom on the constant watch day and night as i was a telling you and not
a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them and

 laws alive i never 

 so help me i wouldnt a be 

 house thieves as well as 

 goodnessgracioussakes id a ben afeard to live in sich a 

 fraid to live why i was that scared i dasnt hardly go to bed or
get up or lay down or set down sister ridgeway why theyd steal the
very why goodness sakes you can guess what kind of a fluster i was
in by the time midnight come last night i hope to gracious if i warnt
afraid theyd steal some o the family i was just to that pass i didnt
have no reasoning faculties no more it looks foolish enough now in the
daytime but i says to myself theres my two poor boys asleep way up
stairs in that lonesome room and i declare to goodness i was that uneasy
t i crep up there and locked em in i did and anybody would 
because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on 
and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling 
and you get to doing all sorts o wild things and by and by you think to
yourself sposn i was a boy and was away up there and the door aint
locked and you she stopped looking kind of wondering and then she
turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on me i got up and
took a walk 

says i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room
this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little so i
done it but i dasnt go fur or shed a sent for me and when it was
late in the day the people all went and then i come in and told her the
noise and shooting waked up me and sid and the door was locked and we
wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightning rod and both of us
got hurt a little and we didnt never want to try that no more and
then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before and then
she said shed forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and
about what a body might expect of boys for all boys was a pretty
harum scarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm
hadnt come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful
we was alive and well and she had us still stead of fretting over what
was past and done so then she kissed me and patted me on the head and
dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says 

 why lawsamercy its most night and sid not come yet what has become
of that boy 

i see my chance so i skips up and says 

 ill run right up to town and get him i says 

 no you wont she says youll stay right wher you are ones enough
to be lost at a time if he aint here to supper your uncle ll go 

well he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncle went 

he come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadnt run across toms
track aunt sally was a good deal uneasy but uncle silas he said there
warnt no occasion to be boys will be boys he said and youll see this
one turn up in the morning all sound and right so she had to be
satisfied but she said shed set up for him a while anyway and keep a
light burning so he could see it 

and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her
candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good i felt mean and like i
couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked
with me a long time and said what a splendid boy sid was and didnt
seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now
and then if i reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded 
and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she
not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and i
would tell her that sid was all right and would be home in the morning 
sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say
it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in
so much trouble and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes
so steady and gentle and says 

 the door aint going to be locked tom and theres the window and the
rod but youll be good wont you and you wont go for my sake 

laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about tom and was all
intending to go but after that i wouldnt a went not for kingdoms 

but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind so i slept very restless 
and twice i went down the rod away in the night and slipped around
front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
eyes towards the road and the tears in them and i wished i could do
something for her but i couldnt only to swear that i wouldnt never do
nothing to grieve her any more and the third time i waked up at dawn 
and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and
her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep 




chapter xlii 

the old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get no track
of tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying
nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not
eating anything and by and by the old man says 

 did i give you the letter 

 what letter 

 the one i got yesterday out of the post office 

 no you didnt give me no letter 

 well i must a forgot it 

so he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down and fetched it and give it to her she says 

 why its from st petersburg its from sis 

i allowed another walk would do me good but i couldnt stir but before
she could break it open she dropped it and run for she see something 
and so did i it was tom sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and
jim in her calico dress with his hands tied behind him and a lot of
people i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and
rushed she flung herself at tom crying and says 

 oh hes dead hes dead i know hes dead 

and tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or other 
which showed he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her hands 
and says 

 hes alive thank god and thats enough and she snatched a kiss of
him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders
right and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tongue
could go every jump of the way 

i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim and the old
doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house the men was
very huffy and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the
other niggers around there so they wouldnt be trying to run away like
jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family
scared most to death for days and nights but the others said dont do
it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger and his owner would
turn up and make us pay for him sure so that cooled them down a
little because the people thats always the most anxious for to hang a
nigger that haint done just right is always the very ones that aint the
most anxious to pay for him when theyve got their satisfaction out of
him 

they cussed jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the
head once in a while but jim never said nothing and he never let on to
know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothes on
him and chained him again and not to no bed leg this time but to a big
staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too and both
legs and said he warnt to have nothing but bread and water to eat after
this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didnt
come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a
couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every
night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time
they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl
good bye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and
says 

 dont be no rougher on him than youre obleeged to because he aint a
bad nigger when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldnt cut the
bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condition for me to
leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse 
and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt let me come
a nigh him any more and said if i chalked his raft hed kill me and no
end of wild foolishness like that and i see i couldnt do anything at
all with him so i says i got to have help somehow and the minute i
says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says hell help and
he done it too and done it very well of course i judged he must be a
runaway nigger and there i was and there i had to stick right straight
along all the rest of the day and all night it was a fix i tell you 
i had a couple of patients with the chills and of course id of liked to
run up to town and see them but i dasnt because the nigger might get
away and then id be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough
for me to hail so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this
morning and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller 
and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too 
and i see plain enough hed been worked main hard lately i liked the
nigger for that i tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a
thousand dollars and kind treatment too i had everything i needed 
and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home better 
maybe because it was so quiet but there i was with both of m on my
hands and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning then some
men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was
setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so
i motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and
tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble 
and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars
and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the
nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start he aint
no bad nigger gentlemen thats what i think about him 

somebody says 

 well it sounds very good doctor im obleeged to say 

then the others softened up a little too and i was mighty thankful to
that old doctor for doing jim that good turn and i was glad it was
according to my judgment of him too because i thought he had a good
heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him then they all
agreed that jim had acted very well and was deserving to have some
notice took of it and reward so every one of them promised right out
and hearty that they wouldnt cuss him no more 

then they come out and locked him up i hoped they was going to say he
could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten
heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they
didnt think of it and i reckoned it warnt best for me to mix in but i
judged id get the doctors yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon
as id got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me
 explanations i mean of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot
when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
around hunting the runaway nigger 

but i had plenty time aunt sally she stuck to the sick room all day and
all night and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him 

next morning i heard tom was a good deal better and they said aunt sally
was gone to get a nap so i slips to the sick room and if i found him
awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash 
but he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not
fire faced the way he was when he come so i set down and laid for him
to wake in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in and there i
was up a stump again she motioned me to be still and set down by me 
and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all
the symptoms was first rate and hed been sleeping like that for ever so
long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one
hed wake up in his right mind 

so we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his
eyes very natural and takes a look and says 

 hello why im at home hows that wheres the raft 

 its all right i says 

 and jim 

 the same i says but couldnt say it pretty brash but he never
noticed but says 

 good splendid now were all right and safe did you tell aunty 

i was going to say yes but she chipped in and says about what sid 

 why about the way the whole thing was done 

 what whole thing 

 why the whole thing there aint but one how we set the runaway
nigger free me and tom 

 good land set the run what is the child talking about dear dear 
out of his head again 

 no i aint out of my head i know all what im talking about we did
set him free me and tom we laid out to do it and we done it and we
done it elegant too hed got a start and she never checked him up 
just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and i see it
warnt no use for me to put in why aunty it cost us a power of work
 weeks of it hours and hours every night whilst you was all asleep 
and we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your
dress and spoons and tin plates and case knives and the warming pan 
and the grindstone and flour and just no end of things and you cant
think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and
one thing or another and you cant think half the fun it was and we
had to make up the pictures of coffins and things and nonnamous letters
from the robbers and get up and down the lightning rod and dig the hole
into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a
pie and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket 

 mercy sakes 

 and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company for
jim and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
you come near spiling the whole business because the men come before we
was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive
at us and i got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go
by and when the dogs come they warnt interested in us but went for the
most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all
safe and jim was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and wasnt
it bully aunty 

 well i never heard the likes of it in all my born days so it was you 
you little rapscallions thats been making all this trouble and turned
everybodys wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death ive
as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o you this very
minute to think here ive been night after night a you just get
well once you young scamp and i lay ill tan the old harry out o both
o ye 

but tom he was so proud and joyful he just couldnt hold in and his
tongue just went it she a chipping in and spitting fire all along and
both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says 

 well you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now for mind i tell
you if i catch you meddling with him again 

 meddling with who tom says dropping his smile and looking surprised 

 with who why the runaway nigger of course whod you reckon 

tom looks at me very grave and says 

 tom didnt you just tell me he was all right hasnt he got away 

 him says aunt sally the runaway nigger deed he hasnt theyve
got him back safe and sound and hes in that cabin again on bread and
water and loaded down with chains till hes claimed or sold 

tom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and
shutting like gills and sings out to me 

 they haint no right to shut him up shove and dont you lose a
minute turn him loose he aint no slave hes as free as any cretur
that walks this earth 

 what does the child mean 

 i mean every word i say aunt sally and if somebody dont go ill go 
ive knowed him all his life and so has tom there old miss watson
died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him
down the river and said so and she set him free in her will 

 then what on earth did you want to set him free for seeing he was
already free 

 well that is a question i must say and just like women why i
wanted the adventure of it and id a waded neck deep in blood to
 goodness alive aunt polly 

if she warnt standing right there just inside the door looking as
sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie i wish i may never 

aunt sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried
over her and i found a good enough place for me under the bed for it
was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me and i peeped out and in
a little while toms aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there
looking across at tom over her spectacles kind of grinding him into the
earth you know and then she says 

 yes you better turn yr head away i would if i was you tom 

 oh deary me says aunt sally is he changed so why that aint tom 
its sid toms toms why where is tom he was here a minute ago 

 you mean wheres huck finn thats what you mean i reckon i haint
raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see
him that would be a pretty howdy do come out from under that bed 
huck finn 

so i done it but not feeling brash 

aunt sally she was one of the mixed upest looking persons i ever see
 except one and that was uncle silas when he come in and they told it
all to him it kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didnt
know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayer meeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest
man in the world couldnt a understood it so toms aunt polly she told
all about who i was and what and i had to up and tell how i was in such
a tight place that when mrs phelps took me for tom sawyer she chipped
in and says oh go on and call me aunt sally im used to it now and
taint no need to change that when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i
had to stand it there warnt no other way and i knowed he wouldnt
mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and hed make an
adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied and so it turned out 
and he let on to be sid and made things as soft as he could for me 

and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting
jim free in her will and so sure enough tom sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free and i couldnt
ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he could
help a body set a nigger free with his bringing up 

well aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and
sid had come all right and safe she says to herself 

 look at that now i might have expected it letting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him so now i got to go and trapse all the
way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creeturs
up to this time as long as i couldnt seem to get any answer out of you
about it 

 why i never heard nothing from you says aunt sally 

 well i wonder why i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
by sid being here 

 well i never got em sis 

aunt polly she turns around slow and severe and says 

 you tom 

 well what he says kind of pettish 

 don t you what me you impudent thing hand out them letters 

 what letters 

 them letters i be bound if i have to take a holt of you ill 

 theyre in the trunk there now and theyre just the same as they
was when i got them out of the office i haint looked into them i
haint touched them but i knowed theyd make trouble and i thought if
you warnt in no hurry id 

 well you do need skinning there aint no mistake about it and i
wrote another one to tell you i was coming and i spose he 

 no it come yesterday i haint read it yet but its all right ive
got that one 

i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadnt but i reckoned maybe it
was just as safe to not to so i never said nothing 




chapter the last

the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea time
of the evasion what it was hed planned to do if the evasion worked all
right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before 
and he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got
jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about
his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and
pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the
niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brass band and then he would be a hero and so would
we but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was 

we had jim out of the chains in no time and when aunt polly and uncle
silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom 
they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him
all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do and we had him
up to the sick room and had a high talk and tom give jim forty dollars
for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and jim
was pleased most to death and busted out and says 

 dah now huck what i tell you what i tell you up dah on jackson
islan i tole you i got a hairy breas en whats de sign un it en i
tole you i ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich agin en its come
true en heah she is dah now doan talk to me signs is signs mine i
tell you en i knowed jis s well at i uz gwineter be rich agin as is
a stannin heah dis minute 

and then tom he talked along and talked along and says les all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go for
howling adventures amongst the injuns over in the territory for a
couple of weeks or two and i says all right that suits me but i aint
got no money for to buy the outfit and i reckon i couldnt get none from
home because its likely paps been back before now and got it all away
from judge thatcher and drunk it up 

 no he haint tom says its all there yet six thousand dollars and
more and your pap haint ever been back since hadnt when i come away 
anyhow 

jim says kind of solemn 

 he aint a comin back no mo huck 

i says 

 why jim 

 nemmine why huck but he aint comin back no mo 

but i kept at him so at last he says 

 doan you member de house dat was floatn down de river en dey wuz a
man in dah kivered up en i went in en unkivered him and didn let you
come in well den you kin git yo money when you wants it kase dat
wuz him 

toms most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watch guard
for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there aint
nothing more to write about and i am rotten glad of it because if id a
knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldnt a tackled it and
aint a going to no more but i reckon i got to light out for the
territory ahead of the rest because aunt sally shes going to adopt me
and sivilize me and i cant stand it i been there before 

the end yours truly huck finn 


 the adventures of tom sawyer
 by
 mark twain
 samuel langhorne clemens 




 p r e f a c e

most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred one or
two were experiences of my own the rest those of boys who were
schoolmates of mine huck finn is drawn from life tom sawyer also but
not from an individual he is a combination of the characteristics of
three boys whom i knew and therefore belongs to the composite order of
architecture 

the odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children
and slaves in the west at the period of this story that is to say 
thirty or forty years ago 

although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and
girls i hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account 
for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what
they once were themselves and of how they felt and thought and talked 
and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in

the old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
room then she put them up and looked out under them she seldom or
never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy they were her
state pair the pride of her heart and were built for style not
service she could have seen through a pair of stove lids just as well 
she looked perplexed for a moment and then said not fiercely but
still loud enough for the furniture to hear 

 well i lay if i get hold of you ill 

she did not finish for by this time she was bending down and punching
under the bed with the broom and so she needed breath to punctuate the
punches with she resurrected nothing but the cat 

 i never did see the beat of that boy 

she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
tomato vines and jimpson weeds that constituted the garden no tom 
so she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and
shouted 

 y o u u tom 

there was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to
seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight 

 there i might a thought of that closet what you been doing in
there 

 nothing 

 nothing look at your hands and look at your mouth what is that
truck 

 i dont know aunt 

 well i know its jam thats what it is forty times ive said if
you didnt let that jam alone id skin you hand me that switch 

the switch hovered in the air the peril was desperate 

 my look behind you aunt 

the old lady whirled round and snatched her skirts out of danger the
lad fled on the instant scrambled up the high board fence and
disappeared over it 

his aunt polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentle
laugh 

 hang the boy cant i never learn anything aint he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time but old
fools is the biggest fools there is cant learn an old dog new tricks 
as the saying is but my goodness he never plays them alike two days 
and how is a body to know whats coming he pears to know just how
long he can torment me before i get my dander up and he knows if he
can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh its all down
again and i cant hit him a lick i aint doing my duty by that boy 
and thats the lords truth goodness knows spare the rod and spile
the child as the good book says im a laying up sin and suffering for
us both i know hes full of the old scratch but laws a me hes my
own dead sisters boy poor thing and i aint got the heart to lash
him somehow every time i let him off my conscience does hurt me so 
and every time i hit him my old heart most breaks well a well man
that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble as the
scripture says and i reckon its so hell play hookey this evening 
and southwestern for afternoon ill just be obleeged to make him
work to morrow to punish him its mighty hard to make him work
saturdays when all the boys is having holiday but he hates work more
than he hates anything else and ive got to do some of my duty by him 
or ill be the ruination of the child 

tom did play hookey and he had a very good time he got back home
barely in season to help jim the small colored boy saw next days
wood and split the kindlings before supper at least he was there in
time to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three fourths of the
work toms younger brother or rather half brother sid was already
through with his part of the work picking up chips for he was a
quiet boy and had no adventurous troublesome ways 

while tom was eating his supper and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered aunt polly asked him questions that were full of guile and
very deep for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments like
many other simple hearted souls it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning said she 

 tom it was middling warm in school warnt it 

 yesm 

 powerful warm warnt it 

 yesm 

 didnt you want to go in a swimming tom 

a bit of a scare shot through tom a touch of uncomfortable suspicion 
he searched aunt pollys face but it told him nothing so he said 

 nom well not very much 

the old lady reached out her hand and felt toms shirt and said 

 but you aint too warm now though and it flattered her to reflect
that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind but in spite of her tom knew
where the wind lay now so he forestalled what might be the next move 

 some of us pumped on our heads mines damp yet see 

aunt polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence and missed a trick then she had a new
inspiration 

 tom you didnt have to undo your shirt collar where i sewed it to
pump on your head did you unbutton your jacket 

the trouble vanished out of toms face he opened his jacket his
shirt collar was securely sewed 

 bother well go long with you id made sure youd played hookey
and been a swimming but i forgive ye tom i reckon youre a kind of a
singed cat as the saying is bettern you look this time 

she was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried and half glad that tom
had stumbled into obedient conduct for once 

but sidney said 

 well now if i didnt think you sewed his collar with white thread 
but its black 

 why i did sew it with white tom 

but tom did not wait for the rest as he went out at the door he said 

 siddy ill lick you for that 

in a safe place tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket and had thread bound about them one needle
carried white thread and the other black he said 

 shed never noticed if it hadnt been for sid confound it sometimes
she sews it with white and sometimes she sews it with black i wish to
geeminy shed stick to one or tother i cant keep the run of em but
i bet you ill lam sid for that ill learn him 

he was not the model boy of the village he knew the model boy very
well though and loathed him 

within two minutes or even less he had forgotten all his troubles 
not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him
than a mans are to a man but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time just as mens
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises this
new interest was a valued novelty in whistling which he had just
acquired from a negro and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed 
it consisted in a peculiar bird like turn a sort of liquid warble 
produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
intervals in the midst of the music the reader probably remembers how
to do it if he has ever been a boy diligence and attention soon gave
him the knack of it and he strode down the street with his mouth full
of harmony and his soul full of gratitude he felt much as an
astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet no doubt as far as
strong deep unalloyed pleasure is concerned the advantage was with
the boy not the astronomer 

the summer evenings were long it was not dark yet presently tom
checked his whistle a stranger was before him a boy a shade larger
than himself a new comer of any age or either sex was an impressive
curiosity in the poor little shabby village of st petersburg this boy
was well dressed too well dressed on a week day this was simply
astounding his cap was a dainty thing his close buttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty and so were his pantaloons he had shoes
on and it was only friday he even wore a necktie a bright bit of
ribbon he had a citified air about him that ate into toms vitals the
more tom stared at the splendid marvel the higher he turned up his
nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed
to him to grow neither boy spoke if one moved the other moved but
only sidewise in a circle they kept face to face and eye to eye all
the time finally tom said 

 i can lick you 

 id like to see you try it 

 well i can do it 

 no you cant either 

 yes i can 

 no you cant 

 i can 

 you cant 

 can 

 cant 

an uncomfortable pause then tom said 

 whats your name 

 tisnt any of your business maybe 

 well i low ill make it my business 

 well why dont you 

 if you say much i will 

 much much much there now 

 oh you think youre mighty smart dont you i could lick you with
one hand tied behind me if i wanted to 

 well why dont you do it you say you can do it 

 well i will if you fool with me 

 oh yes ive seen whole families in the same fix 

 smarty you think youre some now dont you oh what a hat 

 you can lump that hat if you dont like it i dare you to knock it
off and anybody thatll take a dare will suck eggs 

 youre a liar 

 youre another 

 youre a fighting liar and dasnt take it up 

 aw take a walk 

 say if you give me much more of your sass ill take and bounce a
rock offn your head 

 oh of course you will 

 well i will 

 well why dont you do it then what do you keep saying you will for 
why dont you do it its because youre afraid 

 i aint afraid 

 you are 

 i aint 

 you are 

another pause and more eying and sidling around each other presently
they were shoulder to shoulder tom said 

 get away from here 

 go away yourself 

 i wont 

 i wont either 

so they stood each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace and
both shoving with might and main and glowering at each other with
hate but neither could get an advantage after struggling till both
were hot and flushed each relaxed his strain with watchful caution 
and tom said 

 youre a coward and a pup ill tell my big brother on you and he
can thrash you with his little finger and ill make him do it too 

 what do i care for your big brother ive got a brother thats bigger
than he is and whats more he can throw him over that fence too 
 both brothers were imaginary 

 thats a lie 

 your saying so dont make it so 

tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe and said 

 i dare you to step over that and ill lick you till you cant stand
up anybody thatll take a dare will steal sheep 

the new boy stepped over promptly and said 

 now you said youd do it now lets see you do it 

 dont you crowd me now you better look out 

 well you said youd do it why dont you do it 

 by jingo for two cents i will do it 

the new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision tom struck them to the ground in an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt gripped together like cats and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each others hair and
clothes punched and scratched each others nose and covered
themselves with dust and glory presently the confusion took form and
through the fog of battle tom appeared seated astride the new boy and
pounding him with his fists holler nuff said he 

the boy only struggled to free himself he was crying mainly from rage 

 holler nuff and the pounding went on 

at last the stranger got out a smothered nuff and tom let him up
and said 

 now thatll learn you better look out who youre fooling with next
time 

the new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes sobbing 
snuffling and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to tom the next time he caught him out 
to which tom responded with jeers and started off in high feather and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone threw
it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope tom chased the traitor home and thus found out where he
lived he then held a position at the gate for some time daring the
enemy to come outside but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined at last the enemys mother appeared and called
tom a bad vicious vulgar child and ordered him away so he went
away but he said he lowed to lay for that boy 

he got home pretty late that night and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window he uncovered an ambuscade in the person of his aunt 
and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn
his saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in
its firmness 



chapter ii

saturday morning was come and all the summer world was bright and
fresh and brimming with life there was a song in every heart and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips there was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step the locust trees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air cardiff hill beyond
the village and above it was green with vegetation and it lay just far
enough away to seem a delectable land dreamy reposeful and inviting 

tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long handled brush he surveyed the fence and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high life to him seemed hollow and existence but a
burden sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank repeated the operation did it again compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence and sat down on a tree box discouraged jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail and singing buffalo gals bringing water from
the town pump had always been hateful work in toms eyes before but
now it did not strike him so he remembered that there was company at
the pump white mulatto and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns resting trading playthings quarrelling 
fighting skylarking and he remembered that although the pump was only
a hundred and fifty yards off jim never got back with a bucket of
water under an hour and even then somebody generally had to go after
him tom said 

 say jim ill fetch the water if youll whitewash some 

jim shook his head and said 

 cant mars tom ole missis she tole me i got to go an git dis
water an not stop foolin roun wid anybody she say she spec mars
tom gwine to ax me to whitewash an so she tole me go long an tend
to my own business she lowed shed tend to de whitewashin 

 oh never you mind what she said jim thats the way she always
talks gimme the bucket i wont be gone only a a minute she wont
ever know 

 oh i dasnt mars tom ole missis shed take an tar de head offn
me deed she would 

 she she never licks anybody whacks em over the head with her
thimble and who cares for that id like to know she talks awful but
talk dont hurt anyways it dont if she dont cry jim ill give you
a marvel ill give you a white alley 

jim began to waver 

 white alley jim and its a bully taw 

 my dats a mighty gay marvel i tell you but mars tom is powerful
fraid ole missis 

 and besides if you will ill show you my sore toe 

jim was only human this attraction was too much for him he put down
his pail took the white alley and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound in another moment he was
flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear tom was
whitewashing with vigor and aunt polly was retiring from the field
with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye 

but toms energy did not last he began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day and his sorrows multiplied soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to work the very
thought of it burnt him like fire he got out his worldly wealth and
examined it bits of toys marbles and trash enough to buy an
exchange of work maybe but not half enough to buy so much as half an
hour of pure freedom so he returned his straitened means to his
pocket and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys at this dark
and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him nothing less than a
great magnificent inspiration 

he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work ben rogers hove in
sight presently the very boy of all boys whose ridicule he had been
dreading bens gait was the hop skip and jump proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high he was eating an apple and
giving a long melodious whoop at intervals followed by a deep toned
ding dong dong ding dong dong for he was personating a steamboat as
he drew near he slackened speed took the middle of the street leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious
pomp and circumstance for he was personating the big missouri and
considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water he was boat and
captain and engine bells combined so he had to imagine himself
standing on his own hurricane deck giving the orders and executing them 

 stop her sir ting a ling ling the headway ran almost out and he
drew up slowly toward the sidewalk 

 ship up to back ting a ling ling his arms straightened and
stiffened down his sides 

 set her back on the stabboard ting a ling ling chow ch chow wow 
chow his right hand meantime describing stately circles for it was
representing a forty foot wheel 

 let her go back on the labboard ting a lingling chow ch chow chow 
the left hand began to describe circles 

 stop the stabboard ting a ling ling stop the labboard come ahead
on the stabboard stop her let your outside turn over slow 
ting a ling ling chow ow ow get out that head line lively now 
come out with your spring line whatre you about there take a turn
round that stump with the bight of it stand by that stage now let her
go done with the engines sir ting a ling ling sht sht sht 
 trying the gauge cocks 

tom went on whitewashing paid no attention to the steamboat ben
stared a moment and then said hi yi youre up a stump aint you 

no answer tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist then
he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result as
before ben ranged up alongside of him toms mouth watered for the
apple but he stuck to his work ben said 

 hello old chap you got to work hey 

tom wheeled suddenly and said 

 why its you ben i warnt noticing 

 say im going in a swimming i am dont you wish you could but of
course youd druther work wouldnt you course you would 

tom contemplated the boy a bit and said 

 what do you call work 

 why aint that work 

tom resumed his whitewashing and answered carelessly 

 well maybe it is and maybe it aint all i know is it suits tom
sawyer 

 oh come now you dont mean to let on that you like it 

the brush continued to move 

 like it well i dont see why i oughtnt to like it does a boy get
a chance to whitewash a fence every day 

that put the thing in a new light ben stopped nibbling his apple tom
swept his brush daintily back and forth stepped back to note the
effect added a touch here and there criticised the effect again ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested more and more
absorbed presently he said 

 say tom let me whitewash a little 

tom considered was about to consent but he altered his mind 

 no no i reckon it wouldnt hardly do ben you see aunt pollys
awful particular about this fence right here on the street you know
 but if it was the back fence i wouldnt mind and she wouldnt yes 
shes awful particular about this fence its got to be done very
careful i reckon there aint one boy in a thousand maybe two
thousand that can do it the way its got to be done 

 no is that so oh come now lemme just try only just a little id
let you if you was me tom 

 ben id like to honest injun but aunt polly well jim wanted to
do it but she wouldnt let him sid wanted to do it and she wouldnt
let sid now dont you see how im fixed if you was to tackle this
fence and anything was to happen to it 

 oh shucks ill be just as careful now lemme try say ill give
you the core of my apple 

 well here no ben now dont im afeard 

 ill give you all of it 

tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his
heart and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in
the sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by 
dangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of more
innocents there was no lack of material boys happened along every
little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash by the time
ben was fagged out tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for
a kite in good repair and when he played out johnny miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it with and so on and so on 
hour after hour and when the middle of the afternoon came from being
a poor poverty stricken boy in the morning tom was literally rolling
in wealth he had besides the things before mentioned twelve marbles 
part of a jews harp a piece of blue bottle glass to look through a
spool cannon a key that wouldnt unlock anything a fragment of chalk 
a glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles six
fire crackers a kitten with only one eye a brass doorknob a
dog collar but no dog the handle of a knife four pieces of
orange peel and a dilapidated old window sash 

he had had a nice good idle time all the while plenty of company
 and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it if he hadnt run out
of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village 

tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all he
had discovered a great law of human action without knowing it namely 
that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only
necessary to make the thing difficult to attain if he had been a great
and wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have
comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do 
and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do and
this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers
or performing on a tread mill is work while rolling ten pins or
climbing mont blanc is only amusement there are wealthy gentlemen in
england who drive four horse passenger coaches twenty or thirty miles
on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them
considerable money but if they were offered wages for the service 
that would turn it into work and then they would resign 

the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters to
report 



chapter iii

tom presented himself before aunt polly who was sitting by an open
window in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroom 
breakfast room dining room and library combined the balmy summer
air the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing murmur
of the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her knitting
 for she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her lap her
spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety she had thought
that of course tom had deserted long ago and she wondered at seeing him
place himself in her power again in this intrepid way he said maynt
i go and play now aunt 

 what aready how much have you done 

 its all done aunt 

 tom dont lie to me i cant bear it 

 i aint aunt it is all done 

aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence she went out to see
for herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent 
of toms statement true when she found the entire fence whitewashed 
and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and even
a streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable 
she said 

 well i never theres no getting round it you can work when youre
a mind to tom and then she diluted the compliment by adding but
its powerful seldom youre a mind to im bound to say well go long
and play but mind you get back some time in a week or ill tan you 

she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to
him along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a
treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort 
and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish he hooked a
doughnut 

then he skipped out and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway
that led to the back rooms on the second floor clods were handy and
the air was full of them in a twinkling they raged around sid like a
hail storm and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties
and sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect 
and tom was over the fence and gone there was a gate but as a general
thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it his soul was at
peace now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his
black thread and getting him into trouble 

tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by
the back of his aunts cow stable he presently got safely beyond the
reach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square
of the village where two military companies of boys had met for
conflict according to previous appointment tom was general of one of
these armies joe harper a bosom friend general of the other these
two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person that being
better suited to the still smaller fry but sat together on an eminence
and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
aides de camp toms army won a great victory after a long and
hard fought battle then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged 
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the
necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and
marched away and tom turned homeward alone 

as he was passing by the house where jeff thatcher lived he saw a new
girl in the garden a lovely little blue eyed creature with yellow hair
plaited into two long tails white summer frock and embroidered
pantalettes the fresh crowned hero fell without firing a shot a
certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
memory of herself behind he had thought he loved her to distraction 
he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor
little evanescent partiality he had been months winning her she had
confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudest
boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done 

he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that she
had discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present 
and began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order to
win her admiration he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some
time but by and by while he was in the midst of some dangerous
gymnastic performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl
was wending her way toward the house tom came up to the fence and
leaned on it grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer 
she halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door tom
heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold but his face
lit up right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment
before she disappeared 

the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and
then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if
he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction 
presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
nose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to side 
in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finally
his bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and he
hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner but
only for a minute only while he could button the flower inside his
jacket next his heart or next his stomach possibly for he was not
much posted in anatomy and not hypercritical anyway 

he returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing
off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though tom
comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
window meantime and been aware of his attentions finally he strode
home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions 

all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered
 what had got into the child he took a good scolding about clodding
sid and did not seem to mind it in the least he tried to steal sugar
under his aunts very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it he said 

 aunt you dont whack sid when he takes it 

 well sid dont torment a body the way you do youd be always into
that sugar if i warnt watching you 

presently she stepped into the kitchen and sid happy in his
immunity reached for the sugar bowl a sort of glorying over tom which
was wellnigh unbearable but sids fingers slipped and the bowl dropped
and broke tom was in ecstasies in such ecstasies that he even
controlled his tongue and was silent he said to himself that he would
not speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly
still till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and
there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model
 catch it he was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold
himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck
discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles he said to
himself now its coming and the next instant he was sprawling on
the floor the potent palm was uplifted to strike again when tom cried
out 

 hold on now what er you belting me for sid broke it 

aunt polly paused perplexed and tom looked for healing pity but
when she got her tongue again she only said 

 umf well you didnt get a lick amiss i reckon you been into some
other audacious mischief when i wasnt around like enough 

then her conscience reproached her and she yearned to say something
kind and loving but she judged that this would be construed into a
confession that she had been in the wrong and discipline forbade that 
so she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart 
tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes he knew that in her heart
his aunt was on her knees to him and he was morosely gratified by the
consciousness of it he would hang out no signals he would take notice
of none he knew that a yearning glance fell upon him now and then 
through a film of tears but he refused recognition of it he pictured
himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
one little forgiving word but he would turn his face to the wall and
die with that word unsaid ah how would she feel then and he pictured
himself brought home from the river dead with his curls all wet and
his sore heart at rest how she would throw herself upon him and how
her tears would fall like rain and her lips pray god to give her back
her boy and she would never never abuse him any more but he would lie
there cold and white and make no sign a poor little sufferer whose
griefs were at an end he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos
of these dreams that he had to keep swallowing he was so like to
choke and his eyes swam in a blur of water which overflowed when he
winked and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose and such a
luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows that he could not bear
to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it 
it was too sacred for such contact and so presently when his cousin
mary danced in all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an
age long visit of one week to the country he got up and moved in
clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in
at the other 

he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys and sought
desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit a log raft in the
river invited him and he seated himself on its outer edge and
contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream wishing the while 
that he could only be drowned all at once and unconsciously without
undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature then he thought
of his flower he got it out rumpled and wilted and it mightily
increased his dismal felicity he wondered if she would pity him if she
knew would she cry and wish that she had a right to put her arms
around his neck and comfort him or would she turn coldly away like all
the hollow world this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable
suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it
up in new and varied lights till he wore it threadbare at last he
rose up sighing and departed in the darkness 

about half past nine or ten oclock he came along the deserted street
to where the adored unknown lived he paused a moment no sound fell
upon his listening ear a candle was casting a dull glow upon the
curtain of a second story window was the sacred presence there he
climbed the fence threaded his stealthy way through the plants till
he stood under that window he looked up at it long and with emotion 
then he laid him down on the ground under it disposing himself upon
his back with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor
wilted flower and thus he would die out in the cold world with no
shelter over his homeless head no friendly hand to wipe the
death damps from his brow no loving face to bend pityingly over him
when the great agony came and thus she would see him when she looked
out upon the glad morning and oh would she drop one little tear upon
his poor lifeless form would she heave one little sigh to see a bright
young life so rudely blighted so untimely cut down 

the window went up a maid servants discordant voice profaned the
holy calm and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyrs remains 

the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort there was a whiz
as of a missile in the air mingled with the murmur of a curse a sound
as of shivering glass followed and a small vague form went over the
fence and shot away in the gloom 

not long after as tom all undressed for bed was surveying his
drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip sid woke up but if he
had any dim idea of making any references to allusions he thought
better of it and held his peace for there was danger in toms eye 

tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers and sid made
mental note of the omission 



chapter iv

the sun rose upon a tranquil world and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction breakfast over aunt polly had family
worship it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of scriptural quotations welded together with a thin mortar of
originality and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter
of the mosaic law as from sinai 

then tom girded up his loins so to speak and went to work to get
his verses sid had learned his lesson days before tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses and he chose part of the
sermon on the mount because he could find no verses that were shorter 
at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson 
but no more for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought and his hands were busy with distracting recreations mary
took his book to hear him recite and he tried to find his way through
the fog 

 blessed are the a a 

 poor 

 yes poor blessed are the poor a a 

 in spirit 

 in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for they they 

 theirs 

 for theirs blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they they 

 sh 

 for they a 

 s h a 

 for they s h oh i dont know what it is 

 shall 

 oh shall for they shall for they shall a a shall mourn a a 
blessed are they that shall they that a they that shall mourn for
they shall a shall what why dont you tell me mary what do you
want to be so mean for 

 oh tom you poor thick headed thing im not teasing you i wouldnt
do that you must go and learn it again dont you be discouraged tom 
youll manage it and if you do ill give you something ever so nice 
there now thats a good boy 

 all right what is it mary tell me what it is 

 never you mind tom you know if i say its nice it is nice 

 you bet you thats so mary all right ill tackle it again 

and he did tackle it again and under the double pressure of
curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he
accomplished a shining success mary gave him a brand new barlow 
knife worth twelve and a half cents and the convulsion of delight that
swept his system shook him to his foundations true the knife would
not cut anything but it was a sure enough barlow and there was
inconceivable grandeur in that though where the western boys ever got
the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its
injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so perhaps tom
contrived to scarify the cupboard with it and was arranging to begin
on the bureau when he was called off to dress for sunday school 

mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleeves 
poured out the water on the ground gently and then entered the
kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the
door but mary removed the towel and said 

 now aint you ashamed tom you mustnt be so bad water wont hurt
you 

tom was a trifle disconcerted the basin was refilled and this time
he stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a big
breath and began when he entered the kitchen presently with both eyes
shut and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimony
of suds and water was dripping from his face but when he emerged from
the towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck mary took him in hand and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother without distinction of
color and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect he privately
smoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered his
hair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate and
his own filled his life with bitterness then mary got out a suit of
his clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years they
were simply called his other clothes and so by that we know the
size of his wardrobe the girl put him to rights after he had dressed
himself she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned his
vast shirt collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crowned
him with his speckled straw hat he now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for there
was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him he
hoped that mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted she
coated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought them
out he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didnt want to do but mary said persuasively 

 please tom thats a good boy 

so he got into the shoes snarling mary was soon ready and the three
children set out for sunday school a place that tom hated with his
whole heart but sid and mary were fond of it 

sabbath school hours were from nine to half past ten and then church
service two of the children always remained for the sermon
voluntarily and the other always remained too for stronger reasons 
the churchs high backed uncushioned pews would seat about three
hundred persons the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sort
of pine board tree box on top of it for a steeple at the door tom
dropped back a step and accosted a sunday dressed comrade 

 say billy got a yaller ticket 

 yes 

 whatll you take for her 

 whatll you give 

 piece of lickrish and a fish hook 

 less see em 

tom exhibited they were satisfactory and the property changed hands 
then tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets and
some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones he waylaid other
boys as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or
fifteen minutes longer he entered the church now with a swarm of
clean and noisy boys and girls proceeded to his seat and started a
quarrel with the first boy that came handy the teacher a grave 
elderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and tom pulled a
boys hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hear
him say ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher toms whole
class were of a pattern restless noisy and troublesome when they
came to recite their lessons not one of them knew his verses
perfectly but had to be prompted all along however they worried
through and each got his reward in small blue tickets each with a
passage of scripture on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses of
the recitation ten blue tickets equalled a red one and could be
exchanged for it ten red tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellow
tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound bible worth forty
cents in those easy times to the pupil how many of my readers would
have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses even
for a dore bible and yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way it
was the patient work of two years and a boy of german parentage had
won four or five he once recited three thousand verses without
stopping but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great and
he was little better than an idiot from that day forth a grievous
misfortune for the school for on great occasions before company the
superintendent as tom expressed it had always made this boy come out
and spread himself only the older pupils managed to keep their
tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a bible and
so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy
circumstance the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for
that day that on the spot every scholars heart was fired with a fresh
ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks it is possible that toms
mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes but
unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory
and the eclat that came with it 

in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit with
a closed hymn book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
leaves and commanded attention when a sunday school superintendent
makes his customary little speech a hymn book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert
 though why is a mystery for neither the hymn book nor the sheet of
music is ever referred to by the sufferer this superintendent was a
slim creature of thirty five with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair 
he wore a stiff standing collar whose upper edge almost reached his
ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his
mouth a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turning
of the whole body when a side view was required his chin was propped
on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank note 
and had fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in the
fashion of the day like sleigh runners an effect patiently and
laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes
pressed against a wall for hours together mr walters was very earnest
of mien and very sincere and honest at heart and he held sacred
things and places in such reverence and so separated them from worldly
matters that unconsciously to himself his sunday school voice had
acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week days he
began after this fashion 

 now children i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty
as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two there
 that is it that is the way good little boys and girls should do i see
one little girl who is looking out of the window i am afraid she
thinks i am out there somewhere perhaps up in one of the trees making
a speech to the little birds applausive titter i want to tell you
how good it makes me feel to see so many bright clean little faces
assembled in a place like this learning to do right and be good and
so forth and so on it is not necessary to set down the rest of the
oration it was of a pattern which does not vary and so it is familiar
to us all 

the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the bases
of isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary but now every
sound ceased suddenly with the subsidence of mr walters voice and
the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent
gratitude 

a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which
was more or less rare the entrance of visitors lawyer thatcher 
accompanied by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middle aged
gentleman with iron gray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtless
the latters wife the lady was leading a child tom had been restless
and full of chafings and repinings conscience smitten too he could
not meet amy lawrences eye he could not brook her loving gaze but
when he saw this small new comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in
a moment the next moment he was showing off with all his might
 cuffing boys pulling hair making faces in a word using every art
that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause his
exaltation had but one alloy the memory of his humiliation in this
angels garden and that record in sand was fast washing out under
the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now 

the visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as mr 
walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school the
middle aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage no less a one
than the county judge altogether the most august creation these
children had ever looked upon and they wondered what kind of material
he was made of and they half wanted to hear him roar and were half
afraid he might too he was from constantinople twelve miles away so
he had travelled and seen the world these very eyes had looked upon
the county court house which was said to have a tin roof the awe
which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence
and the ranks of staring eyes this was the great judge thatcher 
brother of their own lawyer jeff thatcher immediately went forward to
be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school it would
have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings 

 look at him jim hes a going up there say look hes a going to
shake hands with him he is shaking hands with him by jings dont you
wish you was jeff 

mr walters fell to showing off with all sorts of official
bustlings and activities giving orders delivering judgments 
discharging directions here there everywhere that he could find a
target the librarian showed off running hither and thither with his
arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that
insect authority delights in the young lady teachers showed off 
 bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed lifting
pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones
lovingly the young gentlemen teachers showed off with small
scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to
discipline and most of the teachers of both sexes found business up
at the library by the pulpit and it was business that frequently had
to be done over again two or three times with much seeming vexation 
the little girls showed off in various ways and the little boys
 showed off with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads
and the murmur of scufflings and above it all the great man sat and
beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house and warmed himself
in the sun of his own grandeur for he was showing off too 

there was only one thing wanting to make mr walters ecstasy
complete and that was a chance to deliver a bible prize and exhibit a
prodigy several pupils had a few yellow tickets but none had enough
 he had been around among the star pupils inquiring he would have given
worlds now to have that german lad back again with a sound mind 

and now at this moment when hope was dead tom sawyer came forward
with nine yellow tickets nine red tickets and ten blue ones and
demanded a bible this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky walters
was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten
years but there was no getting around it here were the certified
checks and they were good for their face tom was therefore elevated
to a place with the judge and the other elect and the great news was
announced from headquarters it was the most stunning surprise of the
decade and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero
up to the judicial ones altitude and the school had two marvels to
gaze upon in place of one the boys were all eaten up with envy but
those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too
late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by
trading tickets to tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling
whitewashing privileges these despised themselves as being the dupes
of a wily fraud a guileful snake in the grass 

the prize was delivered to tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush for the poor fellows instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light 
perhaps it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom on his premises a dozen would
strain his capacity without a doubt 

amy lawrence was proud and glad and she tried to make tom see it in
her face but he wouldnt look she wondered then she was just a grain
troubled next a dim suspicion came and went came again she watched 
a furtive glance told her worlds and then her heart broke and she was
jealous and angry and the tears came and she hated everybody tom
most of all she thought 

tom was introduced to the judge but his tongue was tied his breath
would hardly come his heart quaked partly because of the awful
greatness of the man but mainly because he was her parent he would
have liked to fall down and worship him if it were in the dark the
judge put his hand on toms head and called him a fine little man and
asked him what his name was the boy stammered gasped and got it out 

 tom 

 oh no not tom it is 

 thomas 

 ah thats it i thought there was more to it maybe thats very
well but youve another one i daresay and youll tell it to me wont
you 

 tell the gentleman your other name thomas said walters and say
sir you mustnt forget your manners 

 thomas sawyer sir 

 thats it thats a good boy fine boy fine manly little fellow 
two thousand verses is a great many very very great many and you
never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them for
knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world its what
makes great men and good men youll be a great man and a good man
yourself some day thomas and then youll look back and say its all
owing to the precious sunday school privileges of my boyhood its all
owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn its all owing to
the good superintendent who encouraged me and watched over me and
gave me a beautiful bible a splendid elegant bible to keep and have
it all for my own always its all owing to right bringing up that is
what you will say thomas and you wouldnt take any money for those
two thousand verses no indeed you wouldnt and now you wouldnt mind
telling me and this lady some of the things youve learned no i know
you wouldnt for we are proud of little boys that learn now no
doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples wont you tell us
the names of the first two that were appointed 

tom was tugging at a button hole and looking sheepish he blushed 
now and his eyes fell mr walters heart sank within him he said to
himself it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
question why did the judge ask him yet he felt obliged to speak up
and say 

 answer the gentleman thomas dont be afraid 

tom still hung fire 

 now i know youll tell me said the lady the names of the first
two disciples were 

 david and goliah 

let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene 



chapter v

about half past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to
ring and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon 
the sunday school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents so as to be under supervision aunt
polly came and tom and sid and mary sat with her tom being placed
next the aisle in order that he might be as far away from the open
window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible the crowd
filed up the aisles the aged and needy postmaster who had seen better
days the mayor and his wife for they had a mayor there among other
unnecessaries the justice of the peace the widow douglass fair 
smart and forty a generous good hearted soul and well to do her
hill mansion the only palace in the town and the most hospitable and
much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that st petersburg
could boast the bent and venerable major and mrs ward lawyer
riverson the new notable from a distance next the belle of the
village followed by a troop of lawn clad and ribbon decked young
heart breakers then all the young clerks in town in a body for they
had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane heads a circling wall of
oiled and simpering admirers till the last girl had run their gantlet 
and last of all came the model boy willie mufferson taking as heedful
care of his mother as if she were cut glass he always brought his
mother to church and was the pride of all the matrons the boys all
hated him he was so good and besides he had been thrown up to them 
so much his white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind as
usual on sundays accidentally tom had no handkerchief and he looked
upon boys who had as snobs 

the congregation being fully assembled now the bell rang once more 
to warn laggards and stragglers and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery the choir always tittered and whispered all
through service there was once a church choir that was not ill bred 
but i have forgotten where it was now it was a great many years ago 
and i can scarcely remember anything about it but i think it was in
some foreign country 

the minister gave out the hymn and read it through with a relish in
a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country 
his voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached
a certain point where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost
word and then plunged down as if from a spring board 

 shall i be car ri ed toe the skies on flowry beds of ease 

 whilst others fight to win the prize and sail thro bloody seas 

he was regarded as a wonderful reader at church sociables he was
always called upon to read poetry and when he was through the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps 
and wall their eyes and shake their heads as much as to say words
cannot express it it is too beautiful too beautiful for this mortal
earth 

after the hymn had been sung the rev mr sprague turned himself into
a bulletin board and read off notices of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
doom a queer custom which is still kept up in america even in cities 
away here in this age of abundant newspapers often the less there is
to justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it 

and now the minister prayed a good generous prayer it was and went
into details it pleaded for the church and the little children of the
church for the other churches of the village for the village itself 
for the county for the state for the state officers for the united
states for the churches of the united states for congress for the
president for the officers of the government for poor sailors tossed
by stormy seas for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
european monarchies and oriental despotisms for such as have the light
and the good tidings and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal for the heathen in the far islands of the sea and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor and be as seed sown in fertile ground yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good amen 

there was a rustling of dresses and the standing congregation sat
down the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer 
he only endured it if he even did that much he was restive all
through it he kept tally of the details of the prayer unconsciously
 for he was not listening but he knew the ground of old and the
clergymans regular route over it and when a little trifle of new
matter was interlarded his ear detected it and his whole nature
resented it he considered additions unfair and scoundrelly in the
midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of
him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together 
embracing its head with its arms and polishing it so vigorously that
it seemed to almost part company with the body and the slender thread
of a neck was exposed to view scraping its wings with its hind legs
and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat tails going
through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly
safe as indeed it was for as sorely as toms hands itched to grab for
it they did not dare he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed
if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on but with the
closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward and the
instant the amen was out the fly was a prisoner of war his aunt
detected the act and made him let it go 

the minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through
an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod
 and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone
and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be
hardly worth the saving tom counted the pages of the sermon after
church he always knew how many pages there had been but he seldom knew
anything else about the discourse however this time he was really
interested for a little while the minister made a grand and moving
picture of the assembling together of the worlds hosts at the
millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a
little child should lead them but the pathos the lesson the moral of
the great spectacle were lost upon the boy he only thought of the
conspicuousness of the principal character before the on looking
nations his face lit with the thought and he said to himself that he
wished he could be that child if it was a tame lion 

now he lapsed into suffering again as the dry argument was resumed 
presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out it was
a large black beetle with formidable jaws a pinchbug he called it 
it was in a percussion cap box the first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the finger a natural fillip followed the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back and the hurt finger
went into the boys mouth the beetle lay there working its helpless
legs unable to turn over tom eyed it and longed for it but it was
safe out of his reach other people uninterested in the sermon found
relief in the beetle and they eyed it too presently a vagrant poodle
dog came idling along sad at heart lazy with the summer softness and
the quiet weary of captivity sighing for change he spied the beetle 
the drooping tail lifted and wagged he surveyed the prize walked
around it smelt at it from a safe distance walked around it again 
grew bolder and took a closer smell then lifted his lip and made a
gingerly snatch at it just missing it made another and another 
began to enjoy the diversion subsided to his stomach with the beetle
between his paws and continued his experiments grew weary at last 
and then indifferent and absent minded his head nodded and little by
little his chin descended and touched the enemy who seized it there
was a sharp yelp a flirt of the poodles head and the beetle fell a
couple of yards away and lit on its back once more the neighboring
spectators shook with a gentle inward joy several faces went behind
fans and handkerchiefs and tom was entirely happy the dog looked
foolish and probably felt so but there was resentment in his heart 
too and a craving for revenge so he went to the beetle and began a
wary attack on it again jumping at it from every point of a circle 
lighting with his fore paws within an inch of the creature making even
closer snatches at it with his teeth and jerking his head till his
ears flapped again but he grew tired once more after a while tried
to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief followed an ant
around with his nose close to the floor and quickly wearied of that 
yawned sighed forgot the beetle entirely and sat down on it then
there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the
aisle the yelps continued and so did the dog he crossed the house in
front of the altar he flew down the other aisle he crossed before the
doors he clamored up the home stretch his anguish grew with his
progress till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit
with the gleam and the speed of light at last the frantic sufferer
sheered from its course and sprang into its masters lap he flung it
out of the window and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and
died in the distance 

by this time the whole church was red faced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter and the sermon had come to a dead standstill the
discourse was resumed presently but it went lame and halting all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth under cover of some remote pew back as if the poor
parson had said a rarely facetious thing it was a genuine relief to
the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction
pronounced 

tom sawyer went home quite cheerful thinking to himself that there
was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of
variety in it he had but one marring thought he was willing that the
dog should play with his pinchbug but he did not think it was upright
in him to carry it off 



chapter vi

monday morning found tom sawyer miserable monday morning always found
him so because it began another weeks slow suffering in school he
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening
holiday it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much
more odious 

tom lay thinking presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
sick then he could stay home from school here was a vague
possibility he canvassed his system no ailment was found and he
investigated again this time he thought he could detect colicky
symptoms and he began to encourage them with considerable hope but
they soon grew feeble and presently died wholly away he reflected
further suddenly he discovered something one of his upper front teeth
was loose this was lucky he was about to begin to groan as a
 starter as he called it when it occurred to him that if he came
into court with that argument his aunt would pull it out and that
would hurt so he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the
present and seek further nothing offered for some little time and
then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that
laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him
lose a finger so the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the
sheet and held it up for inspection but now he did not know the
necessary symptoms however it seemed well worth while to chance it 
so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit 

but sid slept on unconscious 

tom groaned louder and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe 

no result from sid 

tom was panting with his exertions by this time he took a rest and
then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans 

sid snored on 

tom was aggravated he said sid sid and shook him this course
worked well and tom began to groan again sid yawned stretched then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort and began to stare at
tom tom went on groaning sid said 

 tom say tom no response here tom tom what is the matter 
tom and he shook him and looked in his face anxiously 

tom moaned out 

 oh dont sid dont joggle me 

 why whats the matter tom i must call auntie 

 no never mind itll be over by and by maybe dont call anybody 

 but i must dont groan so tom its awful how long you been this
way 

 hours ouch oh dont stir so sid youll kill me 

 tom why didnt you wake me sooner oh tom dont it makes my
flesh crawl to hear you tom what is the matter 

 i forgive you everything sid groan everything youve ever done
to me when im gone 

 oh tom you aint dying are you dont tom oh dont maybe 

 i forgive everybody sid groan tell em so sid and sid you
give my window sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl thats
come to town and tell her 

but sid had snatched his clothes and gone tom was suffering in
reality now so handsomely was his imagination working and so his
groans had gathered quite a genuine tone 

sid flew down stairs and said 

 oh aunt polly come toms dying 

 dying 

 yesm dont wait come quick 

 rubbage i dont believe it 

but she fled up stairs nevertheless with sid and mary at her heels 
and her face grew white too and her lip trembled when she reached
the bedside she gasped out 

 you tom tom whats the matter with you 

 oh auntie im 

 whats the matter with you what is the matter with you child 

 oh auntie my sore toes mortified 

the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little then cried a
little then did both together this restored her and she said 

 tom what a turn you did give me now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this 

the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe the boy felt a
little foolish and he said 

 aunt polly it seemed mortified and it hurt so i never minded my
tooth at all 

 your tooth indeed whats the matter with your tooth 

 one of thems loose and it aches perfectly awful 

 there there now dont begin that groaning again open your mouth 
well your tooth is loose but youre not going to die about that 
mary get me a silk thread and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen 

tom said 

 oh please auntie dont pull it out it dont hurt any more i wish
i may never stir if it does please dont auntie i dont want to stay
home from school 

 oh you dont dont you so all this row was because you thought
youd get to stay home from school and go a fishing tom tom i love
you so and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart
with your outrageousness by this time the dental instruments were
ready the old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to toms tooth
with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost then she seized the
chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boys face the
tooth hung dangling by the bedpost now 

but all trials bring their compensations as tom wended to school
after breakfast he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in
his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and
admirable way he gathered quite a following of lads interested in the
exhibition and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of
fascination and homage up to this time now found himself suddenly
without an adherent and shorn of his glory his heart was heavy and
he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasnt anything to
spit like tom sawyer but another boy said sour grapes and he
wandered away a dismantled hero 

shortly tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village huckleberry
finn son of the town drunkard huckleberry was cordially hated and
dreaded by all the mothers of the town because he was idle and lawless
and vulgar and bad and because all their children admired him so and
delighted in his forbidden society and wished they dared to be like
him tom was like the rest of the respectable boys in that he envied
huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition and was under strict orders
not to play with him so he played with him every time he got a chance 
huckleberry was always dressed in the cast off clothes of full grown
men and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags his hat
was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim his coat 
when he wore one hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
far down the back but one suspender supported his trousers the seat
of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing the fringed legs
dragged in the dirt when not rolled up 

huckleberry came and went at his own free will he slept on doorsteps
in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet he did not have to go to
school or to church or call any being master or obey anybody he could
go fishing or swimming when and where he chose and stay as long as it
suited him nobody forbade him to fight he could sit up as late as he
pleased he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
and the last to resume leather in the fall he never had to wash nor
put on clean clothes he could swear wonderfully in a word everything
that goes to make life precious that boy had so thought every
harassed hampered respectable boy in st petersburg 

tom hailed the romantic outcast 

 hello huckleberry 

 hello yourself and see how you like it 

 whats that you got 

 dead cat 

 lemme see him huck my hes pretty stiff whered you get him 

 bought him offn a boy 

 what did you give 

 i give a blue ticket and a bladder that i got at the slaughter house 

 whered you get the blue ticket 

 bought it offn ben rogers two weeks ago for a hoop stick 

 say what is dead cats good for huck 

 good for cure warts with 

 no is that so i know something thats better 

 i bet you dont what is it 

 why spunk water 

 spunk water i wouldnt give a dern for spunk water 

 you wouldnt wouldnt you dyou ever try it 

 no i haint but bob tanner did 

 who told you so 

 why he told jeff thatcher and jeff told johnny baker and johnny
told jim hollis and jim told ben rogers and ben told a nigger and
the nigger told me there now 

 well what of it theyll all lie leastways all but the nigger i
dont know him but i never see a nigger that wouldnt lie shucks now
you tell me how bob tanner done it huck 

 why he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the
rain water was 

 in the daytime 

 certainly 

 with his face to the stump 

 yes least i reckon so 

 did he say anything 

 i dont reckon he did i dont know 

 aha talk about trying to cure warts with spunk water such a blame
fool way as that why that aint a going to do any good you got to go
all by yourself to the middle of the woods where you know theres a
spunk water stump and just as its midnight you back up against the
stump and jam your hand in and say 

 barley corn barley corn injun meal shorts 
 spunk water spunk water swaller these warts 

and then walk away quick eleven steps with your eyes shut and then
turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody 
because if you speak the charms busted 

 well that sounds like a good way but that aint the way bob tanner
done 

 no sir you can bet he didnt becuz hes the wartiest boy in this
town and he wouldnt have a wart on him if hed knowed how to work
spunk water ive took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way 
huck i play with frogs so much that ive always got considerable many
warts sometimes i take em off with a bean 

 yes beans good ive done that 

 have you whats your way 

 you take and split the bean and cut the wart so as to get some
blood and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and
dig a hole and bury it bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of
the moon and then you burn up the rest of the bean you see that piece
thats got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing trying to
fetch the other piece to it and so that helps the blood to draw the
wart and pretty soon off she comes 

 yes thats it huck thats it though when youre burying it if you
say down bean off wart come no more to bother me its better 
thats the way joe harper does and hes been nearly to coonville and
most everywheres but say how do you cure em with dead cats 

 why you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard long about
midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried and when its
midnight a devil will come or maybe two or three but you cant see
em you can only hear something like the wind or maybe hear em talk 
and when theyre taking that feller away you heave your cat after em
and say devil follow corpse cat follow devil warts follow cat im
done with ye thatll fetch any wart 

 sounds right dyou ever try it huck 

 no but old mother hopkins told me 

 well i reckon its so then becuz they say shes a witch 

 say why tom i know she is she witched pap pap says so his own
self he come along one day and he see she was a witching him so he
took up a rock and if she hadnt dodged hed a got her well that
very night he rolled offn a shed wher he was a layin drunk and broke
his arm 

 why thats awful how did he know she was a witching him 

 lord pap can tell easy pap says when they keep looking at you
right stiddy theyre a witching you specially if they mumble becuz
when they mumble theyre saying the lords prayer backards 

 say hucky when you going to try the cat 

 to night i reckon theyll come after old hoss williams to night 

 but they buried him saturday didnt they get him saturday night 

 why how you talk how could their charms work till midnight and
then its sunday devils dont slosh around much of a sunday i dont
reckon 

 i never thought of that thats so lemme go with you 

 of course if you aint afeard 

 afeard taint likely will you meow 

 yes and you meow back if you get a chance last time you kep me
a meowing around till old hays went to throwing rocks at me and says
dern that cat and so i hove a brick through his window but dont
you tell 

 i wont i couldnt meow that night becuz auntie was watching me 
but ill meow this time say whats that 

 nothing but a tick 

 whered you get him 

 out in the woods 

 whatll you take for him 

 i dont know i dont want to sell him 

 all right its a mighty small tick anyway 

 oh anybody can run a tick down that dont belong to them im
satisfied with it its a good enough tick for me 

 sho theres ticks a plenty i could have a thousand of em if i
wanted to 

 well why dont you becuz you know mighty well you cant this is a
pretty early tick i reckon its the first one ive seen this year 

 say huck ill give you my tooth for him 

 less see it 

tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it huckleberry
viewed it wistfully the temptation was very strong at last he said 

 is it genuwyne 

tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy 

 well all right said huckleberry its a trade 

tom enclosed the tick in the percussion cap box that had lately been
the pinchbugs prison and the boys separated each feeling wealthier
than before 

when tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse he strode in
briskly with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed 
he hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with
business like alacrity the master throned on high in his great
splint bottom arm chair was dozing lulled by the drowsy hum of study 
the interruption roused him 

 thomas sawyer 

tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full it meant trouble 

 sir 

 come up here now sir why are you late again as usual 

tom was about to take refuge in a lie when he saw two long tails of
yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
sympathy of love and by that form was the only vacant place on the
girls side of the schoolhouse he instantly said 

 i stopped to talk with huckleberry finn 

the masters pulse stood still and he stared helplessly the buzz of
study ceased the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
mind the master said 

 you you did what 

 stopped to talk with huckleberry finn 

there was no mistaking the words 

 thomas sawyer this is the most astounding confession i have ever
listened to no mere ferule will answer for this offence take off your
jacket 

the masters arm performed until it was tired and the stock of
switches notably diminished then the order followed 

 now sir go and sit with the girls and let this be a warning to you 

the titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy but
in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of
his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
fortune he sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl
hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head nudges and winks
and whispers traversed the room but tom sat still with his arms upon
the long low desk before him and seemed to study his book 

by and by attention ceased from him and the accustomed school murmur
rose upon the dull air once more presently the boy began to steal
furtive glances at the girl she observed it made a mouth at him and
gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute when she
cautiously faced around again a peach lay before her she thrust it
away tom gently put it back she thrust it away again but with less
animosity tom patiently returned it to its place then she let it
remain tom scrawled on his slate please take it i got more the
girl glanced at the words but made no sign now the boy began to draw
something on the slate hiding his work with his left hand for a time
the girl refused to notice but her human curiosity presently began to
manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs the boy worked on 
apparently unconscious the girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to
see but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it at last she
gave in and hesitatingly whispered 

 let me see it 

tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable
ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney then the
girls interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot
everything else when it was finished she gazed a moment then
whispered 

 its nice make a man 

the artist erected a man in the front yard that resembled a derrick 
he could have stepped over the house but the girl was not
hypercritical she was satisfied with the monster and whispered 

 its a beautiful man now make me coming along 

tom drew an hour glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and
armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan the girl said 

 its ever so nice i wish i could draw 

 its easy whispered tom ill learn you 

 oh will you when 

 at noon do you go home to dinner 

 ill stay if you will 

 good thats a whack whats your name 

 becky thatcher whats yours oh i know its thomas sawyer 

 thats the name they lick me by im tom when im good you call me
tom will you 

 yes 

now tom began to scrawl something on the slate hiding the words from
the girl but she was not backward this time she begged to see tom
said 

 oh it aint anything 

 yes it is 

 no it aint you dont want to see 

 yes i do indeed i do please let me 

 youll tell 

 no i wont deed and deed and double deed wont 

 you wont tell anybody at all ever as long as you live 

 no i wont ever tell anybody now let me 

 oh you dont want to see 

 now that you treat me so i will see and she put her small hand
upon his and a little scuffle ensued tom pretending to resist in
earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
revealed i love you 

 oh you bad thing and she hit his hand a smart rap but reddened
and looked pleased nevertheless 

just at this juncture the boy felt a slow fateful grip closing on his
ear and a steady lifting impulse in that wise he was borne across the
house and deposited in his own seat under a peppering fire of giggles
from the whole school then the master stood over him during a few
awful moments and finally moved away to his throne without saying a
word but although toms ear tingled his heart was jubilant 

as the school quieted down tom made an honest effort to study but the
turmoil within him was too great in turn he took his place in the
reading class and made a botch of it then in the geography class and
turned lakes into mountains mountains into rivers and rivers into
continents till chaos was come again then in the spelling class and
got turned down by a succession of mere baby words till he brought
up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
ostentation for months 



chapter vii

the harder tom tried to fasten his mind on his book the more his
ideas wandered so at last with a sigh and a yawn he gave it up it
seemed to him that the noon recess would never come the air was
utterly dead there was not a breath stirring it was the sleepiest of
sleepy days the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying
scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees 
away off in the flaming sunshine cardiff hill lifted its soft green
sides through a shimmering veil of heat tinted with the purple of
distance a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air no other
living thing was visible but some cows and they were asleep toms
heart ached to be free or else to have something of interest to do to
pass the dreary time his hand wandered into his pocket and his face
lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer though he did not know
it then furtively the percussion cap box came out he released the
tick and put him on the long flat desk the creature probably glowed
with a gratitude that amounted to prayer too at this moment but it
was premature for when he started thankfully to travel off tom turned
him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction 

toms bosom friend sat next him suffering just as tom had been and
now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an
instant this bosom friend was joe harper the two boys were sworn
friends all the week and embattled enemies on saturdays joe took a
pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner 
the sport grew in interest momently soon tom said that they were
interfering with each other and neither getting the fullest benefit of
the tick so he put joes slate on the desk and drew a line down the
middle of it from top to bottom 

 now said he as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
ill let him alone but if you let him get away and get on my side 
youre to leave him alone as long as i can keep him from crossing over 

 all right go ahead start him up 

the tick escaped from tom presently and crossed the equator joe
harassed him awhile and then he got away and crossed back again this
change of base occurred often while one boy was worrying the tick with
absorbing interest the other would look on with interest as strong 
the two heads bowed together over the slate and the two souls dead to
all things else at last luck seemed to settle and abide with joe the
tick tried this that and the other course and got as excited and as
anxious as the boys themselves but time and again just as he would
have victory in his very grasp so to speak and toms fingers would be
twitching to begin joes pin would deftly head him off and keep
possession at last tom could stand it no longer the temptation was
too strong so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin joe was
angry in a moment said he 

 tom you let him alone 

 i only just want to stir him up a little joe 

 no sir it aint fair you just let him alone 

 blame it i aint going to stir him much 

 let him alone i tell you 

 i wont 

 you shall hes on my side of the line 

 look here joe harper whose is that tick 

 i dont care whose tick he is hes on my side of the line and you
shant touch him 

 well ill just bet i will though hes my tick and ill do what i
blame please with him or die 

a tremendous whack came down on toms shoulders and its duplicate on
joes and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it the boys had been too
absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile
before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over
them he had contemplated a good part of the performance before he
contributed his bit of variety to it 

when school broke up at noon tom flew to becky thatcher and
whispered in her ear 

 put on your bonnet and let on youre going home and when you get to
the corner give the rest of em the slip and turn down through the
lane and come back ill go the other way and come it over em the same
way 

so the one went off with one group of scholars and the other with
another in a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane and
when they reached the school they had it all to themselves then they
sat together with a slate before them and tom gave becky the pencil
and held her hand in his guiding it and so created another surprising
house when the interest in art began to wane the two fell to talking 
tom was swimming in bliss he said 

 do you love rats 

 no i hate them 

 well i do too live ones but i mean dead ones to swing round your
head with a string 

 no i dont care for rats much anyway what i like is chewing gum 

 oh i should say so i wish i had some now 

 do you ive got some ill let you chew it awhile but you must give
it back to me 

that was agreeable so they chewed it turn about and dangled their
legs against the bench in excess of contentment 

 was you ever at a circus said tom 

 yes and my pas going to take me again some time if im good 

 i been to the circus three or four times lots of times church aint
shucks to a circus theres things going on at a circus all the time 
im going to be a clown in a circus when i grow up 

 oh are you that will be nice theyre so lovely all spotted up 

 yes thats so and they get slathers of money most a dollar a day 
ben rogers says say becky was you ever engaged 

 whats that 

 why engaged to be married 

 no 

 would you like to 

 i reckon so i dont know what is it like 

 like why it aint like anything you only just tell a boy you wont
ever have anybody but him ever ever ever and then you kiss and thats
all anybody can do it 

 kiss what do you kiss for 

 why that you know is to well they always do that 

 everybody 

 why yes everybody thats in love with each other do you remember
what i wrote on the slate 

 ye yes 

 what was it 

 i shant tell you 

 shall i tell you 

 ye yes but some other time 

 no now 

 no not now to morrow 

 oh no now please becky ill whisper it ill whisper it ever so
easy 

becky hesitating tom took silence for consent and passed his arm
about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly with his mouth
close to her ear and then he added 

 now you whisper it to me just the same 

she resisted for a while and then said 

 you turn your face away so you cant see and then i will but you
mustnt ever tell anybody will you tom now you wont will you 

 no indeed indeed i wont now becky 

he turned his face away she bent timidly around till her breath
stirred his curls and whispered i love you 

then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches 
with tom after her and took refuge in a corner at last with her
little white apron to her face tom clasped her about her neck and
pleaded 

 now becky its all done all over but the kiss dont you be afraid
of that it aint anything at all please becky and he tugged at her
apron and the hands 

by and by she gave up and let her hands drop her face all glowing
with the struggle came up and submitted tom kissed the red lips and
said 

 now its all done becky and always after this you know you aint
ever to love anybody but me and you aint ever to marry anybody but
me ever never and forever will you 

 no ill never love anybody but you tom and ill never marry
anybody but you and you aint to ever marry anybody but me either 

 certainly of course thats part of it and always coming to school
or when were going home youre to walk with me when there aint
anybody looking and you choose me and i choose you at parties because
thats the way you do when youre engaged 

 its so nice i never heard of it before 

 oh its ever so gay why me and amy lawrence 

the big eyes told tom his blunder and he stopped confused 

 oh tom then i aint the first youve ever been engaged to 

the child began to cry tom said 

 oh dont cry becky i dont care for her any more 

 yes you do tom you know you do 

tom tried to put his arm about her neck but she pushed him away and
turned her face to the wall and went on crying tom tried again with
soothing words in his mouth and was repulsed again then his pride was
up and he strode away and went outside he stood about restless and
uneasy for a while glancing at the door every now and then hoping
she would repent and come to find him but she did not then he began
to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong it was a hard struggle
with him to make new advances now but he nerved himself to it and
entered she was still standing back there in the corner sobbing with
her face to the wall toms heart smote him he went to her and stood a
moment not knowing exactly how to proceed then he said hesitatingly 

 becky i i dont care for anybody but you 

no reply but sobs 

 becky pleadingly becky wont you say something 

more sobs 

tom got out his chiefest jewel a brass knob from the top of an
andiron and passed it around her so that she could see it and said 

 please becky wont you take it 

she struck it to the floor then tom marched out of the house and over
the hills and far away to return to school no more that day presently
becky began to suspect she ran to the door he was not in sight she
flew around to the play yard he was not there then she called 

 tom come back tom 

she listened intently but there was no answer she had no companions
but silence and loneliness so she sat down to cry again and upbraid
herself and by this time the scholars began to gather again and she
had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross
of a long dreary aching afternoon with none among the strangers
about her to exchange sorrows with 



chapter viii

tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of
the track of returning scholars and then fell into a moody jog he
crossed a small branch two or three times because of a prevailing
juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit half an hour
later he was disappearing behind the douglas mansion on the summit of
cardiff hill and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away off
in the valley behind him he entered a dense wood picked his pathless
way to the centre of it and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading
oak there was not even a zephyr stirring the dead noonday heat had
even stilled the songs of the birds nature lay in a trance that was
broken by no sound but the occasional far off hammering of a
woodpecker and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense
of loneliness the more profound the boys soul was steeped in
melancholy his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings he
sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands 
meditating it seemed to him that life was but a trouble at best and
he more than half envied jimmy hodges so lately released it must be
very peaceful he thought to lie and slumber and dream forever and
ever with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the
grass and the flowers over the grave and nothing to bother and grieve
about ever any more if he only had a clean sunday school record he
could be willing to go and be done with it all now as to this girl 
what had he done nothing he had meant the best in the world and been
treated like a dog like a very dog she would be sorry some day maybe
when it was too late ah if he could only die temporarily 

but the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one
constrained shape long at a time tom presently began to drift
insensibly back into the concerns of this life again what if he turned
his back now and disappeared mysteriously what if he went away ever
so far away into unknown countries beyond the seas and never came
back any more how would she feel then the idea of being a clown
recurred to him now only to fill him with disgust for frivolity and
jokes and spotted tights were an offense when they intruded themselves
upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the
romantic no he would be a soldier and return after long years all
war worn and illustrious no better still he would join the indians 
and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the
trackless great plains of the far west and away in the future come
back a great chief bristling with feathers hideous with paint and
prance into sunday school some drowsy summer morning with a
bloodcurdling war whoop and sear the eyeballs of all his companions
with unappeasable envy but no there was something gaudier even than
this he would be a pirate that was it now his future lay plain
before him and glowing with unimaginable splendor how his name would
fill the world and make people shudder how gloriously he would go
plowing the dancing seas in his long low black hulled racer the
spirit of the storm with his grisly flag flying at the fore and at
the zenith of his fame how he would suddenly appear at the old village
and stalk into church brown and weather beaten in his black velvet
doublet and trunks his great jack boots his crimson sash his belt
bristling with horse pistols his crime rusted cutlass at his side his
slouch hat with waving plumes his black flag unfurled with the skull
and crossbones on it and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings 
 its tom sawyer the pirate the black avenger of the spanish main 

yes it was settled his career was determined he would run away from
home and enter upon it he would start the very next morning therefore
he must now begin to get ready he would collect his resources
together he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under
one end of it with his barlow knife he soon struck wood that sounded
hollow he put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively 

 what hasnt come here come whats here stay here 

then he scraped away the dirt and exposed a pine shingle he took it
up and disclosed a shapely little treasure house whose bottom and sides
were of shingles in it lay a marble toms astonishment was boundless 
he scratched his head with a perplexed air and said 

 well that beats anything 

then he tossed the marble away pettishly and stood cogitating the
truth was that a superstition of his had failed here which he and
all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible if you buried a
marble with certain necessary incantations and left it alone a
fortnight and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
used you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had
gathered themselves together there meantime no matter how widely they
had been separated but now this thing had actually and unquestionably
failed toms whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations 
he had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its
failing before it did not occur to him that he had tried it several
times before himself but could never find the hiding places
afterward he puzzled over the matter some time and finally decided
that some witch had interfered and broken the charm he thought he
would satisfy himself on that point so he searched around till he
found a small sandy spot with a little funnel shaped depression in it 
he laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and
called 

 doodle bug doodle bug tell me what i want to know doodle bug 
doodle bug tell me what i want to know 

the sand began to work and presently a small black bug appeared for a
second and then darted under again in a fright 

 he dasnt tell so it was a witch that done it i just knowed it 

he well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches so he
gave up discouraged but it occurred to him that he might as well have
the marble he had just thrown away and therefore he went and made a
patient search for it but he could not find it now he went back to
his treasure house and carefully placed himself just as he had been
standing when he tossed the marble away then he took another marble
from his pocket and tossed it in the same way saying 

 brother go find your brother 

he watched where it stopped and went there and looked but it must
have fallen short or gone too far so he tried twice more the last
repetition was successful the two marbles lay within a foot of each
other 

just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
aisles of the forest tom flung off his jacket and trousers turned a
suspender into a belt raked away some brush behind the rotten log 
disclosing a rude bow and arrow a lath sword and a tin trumpet and in
a moment had seized these things and bounded away barelegged with
fluttering shirt he presently halted under a great elm blew an
answering blast and then began to tiptoe and look warily out this way
and that he said cautiously to an imaginary company 

 hold my merry men keep hid till i blow 

now appeared joe harper as airily clad and elaborately armed as tom 
tom called 

 hold who comes here into sherwood forest without my pass 

 guy of guisborne wants no mans pass who art thou that that 

 dares to hold such language said tom prompting for they talked
 by the book from memory 

 who art thou that dares to hold such language 

 i indeed i am robin hood as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know 

 then art thou indeed that famous outlaw right gladly will i dispute
with thee the passes of the merry wood have at thee 

they took their lath swords dumped their other traps on the ground 
struck a fencing attitude foot to foot and began a grave careful
combat two up and two down presently tom said 

 now if youve got the hang go it lively 

so they went it lively panting and perspiring with the work by and
by tom shouted 

 fall fall why dont you fall 

 i shant why dont you fall yourself youre getting the worst of
it 

 why that aint anything i cant fall that aint the way it is in
the book the book says then with one back handed stroke he slew poor
guy of guisborne youre to turn around and let me hit you in the
back 

there was no getting around the authorities so joe turned received
the whack and fell 

 now said joe getting up you got to let me kill you thats fair 

 why i cant do that it aint in the book 

 well its blamed mean thats all 

 well say joe you can be friar tuck or much the millers son and
lam me with a quarter staff or ill be the sheriff of nottingham and
you be robin hood a little while and kill me 

this was satisfactory and so these adventures were carried out then
tom became robin hood again and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
bleed his strength away through his neglected wound and at last joe 
representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws dragged him sadly forth 
gave his bow into his feeble hands and tom said where this arrow
falls there bury poor robin hood under the greenwood tree then he
shot the arrow and fell back and would have died but he lit on a
nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse 

the boys dressed themselves hid their accoutrements and went off
grieving that there were no outlaws any more and wondering what modern
civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss 
they said they would rather be outlaws a year in sherwood forest than
president of the united states forever 



chapter ix

at half past nine that night tom and sid were sent to bed as usual 
they said their prayers and sid was soon asleep tom lay awake and
waited in restless impatience when it seemed to him that it must be
nearly daylight he heard the clock strike ten this was despair he
would have tossed and fidgeted as his nerves demanded but he was
afraid he might wake sid so he lay still and stared up into the dark 
everything was dismally still by and by out of the stillness little 
scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves the ticking
of the clock began to bring itself into notice old beams began to
crack mysteriously the stairs creaked faintly evidently spirits were
abroad a measured muffled snore issued from aunt pollys chamber and
now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could
locate began next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at
the beds head made tom shudder it meant that somebodys days were
numbered then the howl of a far off dog rose on the night air and was
answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance tom was in an
agony at last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity
begun he began to doze in spite of himself the clock chimed eleven 
but he did not hear it and then there came mingling with his
half formed dreams a most melancholy caterwauling the raising of a
neighboring window disturbed him a cry of scat you devil and the
crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunts woodshed
brought him wide awake and a single minute later he was dressed and
out of the window and creeping along the roof of the ell on all
fours he meowd with caution once or twice as he went then jumped
to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground huckleberry finn
was there with his dead cat the boys moved off and disappeared in the
gloom at the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall
grass of the graveyard 

it was a graveyard of the old fashioned western kind it was on a
hill about a mile and a half from the village it had a crazy board
fence around it which leaned inward in places and outward the rest of
the time but stood upright nowhere grass and weeds grew rank over the
whole cemetery all the old graves were sunken in there was not a
tombstone on the place round topped worm eaten boards staggered over
the graves leaning for support and finding none sacred to the memory
of so and so had been painted on them once but it could no longer
have been read on the most of them now even if there had been light 

a faint wind moaned through the trees and tom feared it might be the
spirits of the dead complaining at being disturbed the boys talked
little and only under their breath for the time and the place and the
pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits they found the
sharp new heap they were seeking and ensconced themselves within the
protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet
of the grave 

then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time the hooting
of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness 
toms reflections grew oppressive he must force some talk so he said
in a whisper 

 hucky do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here 

huckleberry whispered 

 i wisht i knowed its awful solemn like aint it 

 i bet it is 

there was a considerable pause while the boys canvassed this matter
inwardly then tom whispered 

 say hucky do you reckon hoss williams hears us talking 

 o course he does least his sperrit does 

tom after a pause 

 i wish id said mister williams but i never meant any harm 
everybody calls him hoss 

 a body cant be too particlar how they talk bout these yer dead
people tom 

this was a damper and conversation died again 

presently tom seized his comrades arm and said 

 sh 

 what is it tom and the two clung together with beating hearts 

 sh there tis again didnt you hear it 

 i 

 there now you hear it 

 lord tom theyre coming theyre coming sure whatll we do 

 i dono think theyll see us 

 oh tom they can see in the dark same as cats i wisht i hadnt
come 

 oh dont be afeard i dont believe theyll bother us we aint
doing any harm if we keep perfectly still maybe they wont notice us
at all 

 ill try to tom but lord im all of a shiver 

 listen 

the boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed a muffled
sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard 

 look see there whispered tom what is it 

 its devil fire oh tom this is awful 

some vague figures approached through the gloom swinging an
old fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light presently huckleberry whispered with a
shudder 

 its the devils sure enough three of em lordy tom were goners 
can you pray 

 ill try but dont you be afeard they aint going to hurt us now
i lay me down to sleep i 

 sh 

 what is it huck 

 theyre humans one of em is anyway one of ems old muff potters
voice 

 no taint so is it 

 i bet i know it dont you stir nor budge he aint sharp enough to
notice us drunk the same as usual likely blamed old rip 

 all right ill keep still now theyre stuck cant find it here
they come again now theyre hot cold again hot again red hot 
theyre pinted right this time say huck i know another o them
voices its injun joe 

 thats so that murderin half breed id druther they was devils a
dern sight what kin they be up to 

the whisper died wholly out now for the three men had reached the
grave and stood within a few feet of the boys hiding place 

 here it is said the third voice and the owner of it held the
lantern up and revealed the face of young doctor robinson 

potter and injun joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a
couple of shovels on it they cast down their load and began to open
the grave the doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came
and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees he was so
close the boys could have touched him 

 hurry men he said in a low voice the moon might come out at any
moment 

they growled a response and went on digging for some time there was
no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight
of mould and gravel it was very monotonous finally a spade struck
upon the coffin with a dull woody accent and within another minute or
two the men had hoisted it out on the ground they pried off the lid
with their shovels got out the body and dumped it rudely on the
ground the moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid
face the barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it covered
with a blanket and bound to its place with the rope potter took out a
large spring knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then
said 

 now the cussed things ready sawbones and youll just out with
another five or here she stays 

 thats the talk said injun joe 

 look here what does this mean said the doctor you required your
pay in advance and ive paid you 

 yes and you done more than that said injun joe approaching the
doctor who was now standing five years ago you drove me away from
your fathers kitchen one night when i come to ask for something to
eat and you said i warnt there for any good and when i swore id get
even with you if it took a hundred years your father had me jailed for
a vagrant did you think id forget the injun blood aint in me for
nothing and now ive got you and you got to settle you know 

he was threatening the doctor with his fist in his face by this
time the doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the
ground potter dropped his knife and exclaimed 

 here now dont you hit my pard and the next moment he had
grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and
main trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels 
injun joe sprang to his feet his eyes flaming with passion snatched
up potters knife and went creeping catlike and stooping round and
round about the combatants seeking an opportunity all at once the
doctor flung himself free seized the heavy headboard of williams
grave and felled potter to the earth with it and in the same instant
the half breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the
young mans breast he reeled and fell partly upon potter flooding him
with his blood and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the
dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in
the dark 

presently when the moon emerged again injun joe was standing over
the two forms contemplating them the doctor murmured inarticulately 
gave a long gasp or two and was still the half breed muttered 

 that score is settled damn you 

then he robbed the body after which he put the fatal knife in
potters open right hand and sat down on the dismantled coffin three
 four five minutes passed and then potter began to stir and moan his
hand closed upon the knife he raised it glanced at it and let it
fall with a shudder then he sat up pushing the body from him and
gazed at it and then around him confusedly his eyes met joes 

 lord how is this joe he said 

 its a dirty business said joe without moving 

 what did you do it for 

 i i never done it 

 look here that kind of talk wont wash 

potter trembled and grew white 

 i thought id got sober id no business to drink to night but its
in my head yet worsen when we started here im all in a muddle 
cant recollect anything of it hardly tell me joe honest now old
feller did i do it joe i never meant to pon my soul and honor i
never meant to joe tell me how it was joe oh its awful and him
so young and promising 

 why you two was scuffling and he fetched you one with the headboard
and you fell flat and then up you come all reeling and staggering
like and snatched the knife and jammed it into him just as he fetched
you another awful clip and here youve laid as dead as a wedge til
now 

 oh i didnt know what i was a doing i wish i may die this minute if
i did it was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement i
reckon i never used a weepon in my life before joe ive fought but
never with weepons theyll all say that joe dont tell say you
wont tell joe thats a good feller i always liked you joe and
stood up for you too dont you remember you wont tell will you 
joe and the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid
murderer and clasped his appealing hands 

 no youve always been fair and square with me muff potter and i
wont go back on you there now thats as fair as a man can say 

 oh joe youre an angel ill bless you for this the longest day i
live and potter began to cry 

 come now thats enough of that this aint any time for blubbering 
you be off yonder way and ill go this move now and dont leave any
tracks behind you 

potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run the
half breed stood looking after him he muttered 

 if hes as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
had the look of being he wont think of the knife till hes gone so
far hell be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself
 chicken heart 

two or three minutes later the murdered man the blanketed corpse the
lidless coffin and the open grave were under no inspection but the
moons the stillness was complete again too 



chapter x

the two boys flew on and on toward the village speechless with
horror they glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time 
apprehensively as if they feared they might be followed every stump
that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy and made them
catch their breath and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
near the village the barking of the aroused watch dogs seemed to give
wings to their feet 

 if we can only get to the old tannery before we break down 
whispered tom in short catches between breaths i cant stand it much
longer 

huckleberrys hard pantings were his only reply and the boys fixed
their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it 
they gained steadily on it and at last breast to breast they burst
through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
shadows beyond by and by their pulses slowed down and tom whispered 

 huckleberry what do you reckonll come of this 

 if doctor robinson dies i reckon hangingll come of it 

 do you though 

 why i know it tom 

tom thought a while then he said 

 wholl tell we 

 what are you talking about spose something happened and injun joe
didnt hang why hed kill us some time or other just as dead sure as
were a laying here 

 thats just what i was thinking to myself huck 

 if anybody tells let muff potter do it if hes fool enough hes
generally drunk enough 

tom said nothing went on thinking presently he whispered 

 huck muff potter dont know it how can he tell 

 whats the reason he dont know it 

 because hed just got that whack when injun joe done it dyou reckon
he could see anything dyou reckon he knowed anything 

 by hokey thats so tom 

 and besides look a here maybe that whack done for him 

 no taint likely tom he had liquor in him i could see that and
besides he always has well when paps full you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldnt phase him he says so 
his own self so its the same with muff potter of course but if a
man was dead sober i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him i dono 

after another reflective silence tom said 

 hucky you sure you can keep mum 

 tom we got to keep mum you know that that injun devil wouldnt
make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats if we was to
squeak bout this and they didnt hang him now look a here tom less
take and swear to one another thats what we got to do swear to keep
mum 

 im agreed its the best thing would you just hold hands and swear
that we 

 oh no that wouldnt do for this thats good enough for little
rubbishy common things specially with gals cuz they go back on you
anyway and blab if they get in a huff but there orter be writing
bout a big thing like this and blood 

toms whole being applauded this idea it was deep and dark and
awful the hour the circumstances the surroundings were in keeping
with it he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight 
took a little fragment of red keel out of his pocket got the moon on
his work and painfully scrawled these lines emphasizing each slow
down stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth and letting up
the pressure on the up strokes see next page 

 huck finn and
 tom sawyer swears
 they will keep mum
 about this and they
 wish they may drop
 down dead in their
 tracks if they ever
 tell and rot 

huckleberry was filled with admiration of toms facility in writing 
and the sublimity of his language he at once took a pin from his lapel
and was going to prick his flesh but tom said 

 hold on dont do that a pins brass it might have verdigrease on
it 

 whats verdigrease 

 its pison thats what it is you just swaller some of it once
 youll see 

so tom unwound the thread from one of his needles and each boy
pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood in
time after many squeezes tom managed to sign his initials using the
ball of his little finger for a pen then he showed huckleberry how to
make an h and an f and the oath was complete they buried the shingle
close to the wall with some dismal ceremonies and incantations and
the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and
the key thrown away 

a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the
ruined building now but they did not notice it 

 tom whispered huckleberry does this keep us from ever telling
 always 

 of course it does it dont make any difference what happens we got
to keep mum wed drop down dead dont you know that 

 yes i reckon thats so 

they continued to whisper for some little time presently a dog set up
a long lugubrious howl just outside within ten feet of them the boys
clasped each other suddenly in an agony of fright 

 which of us does he mean gasped huckleberry 

 i dono peep through the crack quick 

 no you tom 

 i cant i cant do it huck 

 please tom there tis again 

 oh lordy im thankful whispered tom i know his voice its bull
harbison 

 if mr harbison owned a slave named bull tom would have spoken of
him as harbisons bull but a son or a dog of that name was bull
harbison 

 oh thats good i tell you tom i was most scared to death id a
bet anything it was a stray dog 

the dog howled again the boys hearts sank once more 

 oh my that aint no bull harbison whispered huckleberry do tom 

tom quaking with fear yielded and put his eye to the crack his
whisper was hardly audible when he said 

 oh huck it s a stray dog 

 quick tom quick who does he mean 

 huck he must mean us both were right together 

 oh tom i reckon were goners i reckon there aint no mistake bout
where ill go to i been so wicked 

 dad fetch it this comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
fellers told not to do i might a been good like sid if id a tried
 but no i wouldnt of course but if ever i get off this time i lay
ill just waller in sunday schools and tom began to snuffle a little 

 you bad and huckleberry began to snuffle too consound it tom
sawyer youre just old pie longside o what i am oh lordy lordy 
lordy i wisht i only had half your chance 

tom choked off and whispered 

 look hucky look hes got his back to us 

hucky looked with joy in his heart 

 well he has by jingoes did he before 

 yes he did but i like a fool never thought oh this is bully 
you know now who can he mean 

the howling stopped tom pricked up his ears 

 sh whats that he whispered 

 sounds like like hogs grunting no its somebody snoring tom 

 that is it where bouts is it huck 

 i bleeve its down at tother end sounds so anyway pap used to
sleep there sometimes long with the hogs but laws bless you he
just lifts things when he snores besides i reckon he aint ever
coming back to this town any more 

the spirit of adventure rose in the boys souls once more 

 hucky do you dast to go if i lead 

 i dont like to much tom spose its injun joe 

tom quailed but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try with the understanding that they would take to
their heels if the snoring stopped so they went tiptoeing stealthily
down the one behind the other when they had got to within five steps
of the snorer tom stepped on a stick and it broke with a sharp snap 
the man moaned writhed a little and his face came into the moonlight 
it was muff potter the boys hearts had stood still and their hopes
too when the man moved but their fears passed away now they tiptoed
out through the broken weather boarding and stopped at a little
distance to exchange a parting word that long lugubrious howl rose on
the night air again they turned and saw the strange dog standing
within a few feet of where potter was lying and facing potter with
his nose pointing heavenward 

 oh geeminy its him exclaimed both boys in a breath 

 say tom they say a stray dog come howling around johnny millers
house bout midnight as much as two weeks ago and a whippoorwill
come in and lit on the banisters and sung the very same evening and
there aint anybody dead there yet 

 well i know that and suppose there aint didnt gracie miller fall
in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next saturday 

 yes but she aint dead and whats more shes getting better too 

 all right you wait and see shes a goner just as dead sure as muff
potters a goner thats what the niggers say and they know all about
these kind of things huck 

then they separated cogitating when tom crept in at his bedroom
window the night was almost spent he undressed with excessive caution 
and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his
escapade he was not aware that the gently snoring sid was awake and
had been so for an hour 

when tom awoke sid was dressed and gone there was a late look in the
light a late sense in the atmosphere he was startled why had he not
been called persecuted till he was up as usual the thought filled
him with bodings within five minutes he was dressed and down stairs 
feeling sore and drowsy the family were still at table but they had
finished breakfast there was no voice of rebuke but there were
averted eyes there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a
chill to the culprits heart he sat down and tried to seem gay but it
was up hill work it roused no smile no response and he lapsed into
silence and let his heart sink down to the depths 

after breakfast his aunt took him aside and tom almost brightened in
the hope that he was going to be flogged but it was not so his aunt
wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so 
and finally told him to go on and ruin himself and bring her gray
hairs with sorrow to the grave for it was no use for her to try any
more this was worse than a thousand whippings and toms heart was
sorer now than his body he cried he pleaded for forgiveness promised
to reform over and over again and then received his dismissal feeling
that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a
feeble confidence 

he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward sid 
and so the latters prompt retreat through the back gate was
unnecessary he moped to school gloomy and sad and took his flogging 
along with joe harper for playing hookey the day before with the air
of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
trifles then he betook himself to his seat rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go 
his elbow was pressing against some hard substance after a long time
he slowly and sadly changed his position and took up this object with
a sigh it was in a paper he unrolled it a long lingering colossal
sigh followed and his heart broke it was his brass andiron knob 

this final feather broke the camels back 



chapter xi

close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
with the ghastly news no need of the as yet undreamed of telegraph 
the tale flew from man to man from group to group from house to
house with little less than telegraphic speed of course the
schoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon the town would have
thought strangely of him if he had not 

a gory knife had been found close to the murdered man and it had been
recognized by somebody as belonging to muff potter so the story ran 
and it was said that a belated citizen had come upon potter washing
himself in the branch about one or two oclock in the morning and
that potter had at once sneaked off suspicious circumstances 
especially the washing which was not a habit with potter it was also
said that the town had been ransacked for this murderer the public
are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a
verdict but that he could not be found horsemen had departed down
all the roads in every direction and the sheriff was confident that
he would be captured before night 

all the town was drifting toward the graveyard toms heartbreak
vanished and he joined the procession not because he would not a
thousand times rather go anywhere else but because an awful 
unaccountable fascination drew him on arrived at the dreadful place 
he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal
spectacle it seemed to him an age since he was there before somebody
pinched his arm he turned and his eyes met huckleberrys then both
looked elsewhere at once and wondered if anybody had noticed anything
in their mutual glance but everybody was talking and intent upon the
grisly spectacle before them 

 poor fellow poor young fellow this ought to be a lesson to
grave robbers muff potterll hang for this if they catch him this
was the drift of remark and the minister said it was a judgment his
hand is here 

now tom shivered from head to heel for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of injun joe at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle 
and voices shouted its him its him hes coming himself 

 who who from twenty voices 

 muff potter 

 hallo hes stopped look out hes turning dont let him get away 

people in the branches of the trees over toms head said he wasnt
trying to get away he only looked doubtful and perplexed 

 infernal impudence said a bystander wanted to come and take a
quiet look at his work i reckon didnt expect any company 

the crowd fell apart now and the sheriff came through 
ostentatiously leading potter by the arm the poor fellows face was
haggard and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him when he stood
before the murdered man he shook as with a palsy and he put his face
in his hands and burst into tears 

 i didnt do it friends he sobbed pon my word and honor i never
done it 

 whos accused you shouted a voice 

this shot seemed to carry home potter lifted his face and looked
around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes he saw injun joe 
and exclaimed 

 oh injun joe you promised me youd never 

 is that your knife and it was thrust before him by the sheriff 

potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to
the ground then he said 

 something told me t if i didnt come back and get he shuddered 
then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said tell
em joe tell em it aint any use any more 

then huckleberry and tom stood dumb and staring and heard the
stony hearted liar reel off his serene statement they expecting every
moment that the clear sky would deliver gods lightnings upon his head 
and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed and when he had
finished and still stood alive and whole their wavering impulse to
break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoners life faded and
vanished away for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to satan and
it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that 

 why didnt you leave what did you want to come here for somebody
said 

 i couldnt help it i couldnt help it potter moaned i wanted to
run away but i couldnt seem to come anywhere but here and he fell
to sobbing again 

injun joe repeated his statement just as calmly a few minutes
afterward on the inquest under oath and the boys seeing that the
lightnings were still withheld were confirmed in their belief that joe
had sold himself to the devil he was now become to them the most
balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon and they could
not take their fascinated eyes from his face 

they inwardly resolved to watch him nights when opportunity should
offer in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master 

injun joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a
wagon for removal and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd
that the wound bled a little the boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction but they were
disappointed for more than one villager remarked 

 it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it 

toms fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this and at breakfast one morning sid said 

 tom you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time 

tom blanched and dropped his eyes 

 its a bad sign said aunt polly gravely what you got on your
mind tom 

 nothing nothing t i know of but the boys hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee 

 and you do talk such stuff sid said last night you said its
blood its blood thats what it is you said that over and over and
you said dont torment me so ill tell tell what what is it
youll tell 

everything was swimming before tom there is no telling what might
have happened now but luckily the concern passed out of aunt pollys
face and she came to toms relief without knowing it she said 

 sho its that dreadful murder i dream about it most every night
myself sometimes i dream its me that done it 

mary said she had been affected much the same way sid seemed
satisfied tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could 
and after that he complained of toothache for a week and tied up his
jaws every night he never knew that sid lay nightly watching and
frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow
listening a good while at a time and afterward slipped the bandage
back to its place again toms distress of mind wore off gradually and
the toothache grew irksome and was discarded if sid really managed to
make anything out of toms disjointed mutterings he kept it to himself 

it seemed to tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
inquests on dead cats and thus keeping his trouble present to his
mind sid noticed that tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries 
though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises 
he noticed too that tom never acted as a witness and that was
strange and sid did not overlook the fact that tom even showed a
marked aversion to these inquests and always avoided them when he
could sid marvelled but said nothing however even inquests went out
of vogue at last and ceased to torture toms conscience 

every day or two during this time of sorrow tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the murderer as he could get hold of the
jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
of the village and no guards were afforded for it indeed it was
seldom occupied these offerings greatly helped to ease toms
conscience 

the villagers had a strong desire to tar and feather injun joe and
ride him on a rail for body snatching but so formidable was his
character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead
in the matter so it was dropped he had been careful to begin both of
his inquest statements with the fight without confessing the
grave robbery that preceded it therefore it was deemed wisest not
to try the case in the courts at present 



chapter xii

one of the reasons why toms mind had drifted away from its secret
troubles was that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
itself about becky thatcher had stopped coming to school tom had
struggled with his pride a few days and tried to whistle her down the
wind but failed he began to find himself hanging around her fathers
house nights and feeling very miserable she was ill what if she
should die there was distraction in the thought he no longer took an
interest in war nor even in piracy the charm of life was gone there
was nothing but dreariness left he put his hoop away and his bat 
there was no joy in them any more his aunt was concerned she began to
try all manner of remedies on him she was one of those people who are
infatuated with patent medicines and all new fangled methods of
producing health or mending it she was an inveterate experimenter in
these things when something fresh in this line came out she was in a
fever right away to try it not on herself for she was never ailing 
but on anybody else that came handy she was a subscriber for all the
 health periodicals and phrenological frauds and the solemn ignorance
they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils all the rot they
contained about ventilation and how to go to bed and how to get up 
and what to eat and what to drink and how much exercise to take and
what frame of mind to keep ones self in and what sort of clothing to
wear was all gospel to her and she never observed that her
health journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
had recommended the month before she was as simple hearted and honest
as the day was long and so she was an easy victim she gathered
together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines and thus armed
with death went about on her pale horse metaphorically speaking with
 hell following after but she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of gilead in disguise to the suffering
neighbors 

the water treatment was new now and toms low condition was a
windfall to her she had him out at daylight every morning stood him
up in the woodshed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water then
she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file and so brought him to 
then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets
till she sweated his soul clean and the yellow stains of it came
through his pores as tom said 

yet notwithstanding all this the boy grew more and more melancholy
and pale and dejected she added hot baths sitz baths shower baths 
and plunges the boy remained as dismal as a hearse she began to
assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister plasters she
calculated his capacity as she would a jugs and filled him up every
day with quack cure alls 

tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time this phase
filled the old ladys heart with consternation this indifference must
be broken up at any cost now she heard of pain killer for the first
time she ordered a lot at once she tasted it and was filled with
gratitude it was simply fire in a liquid form she dropped the water
treatment and everything else and pinned her faith to pain killer she
gave tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
result her troubles were instantly at rest her soul at peace again 
for the indifference was broken up the boy could not have shown a
wilder heartier interest if she had built a fire under him 

tom felt that it was time to wake up this sort of life might be
romantic enough in his blighted condition but it was getting to have
too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it so he
thought over various plans for relief and finally hit pon that of
professing to be fond of pain killer he asked for it so often that he
became a nuisance and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself
and quit bothering her if it had been sid she would have had no
misgivings to alloy her delight but since it was tom she watched the
bottle clandestinely she found that the medicine did really diminish 
but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a
crack in the sitting room floor with it 

one day tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunts yellow
cat came along purring eying the teaspoon avariciously and begging
for a taste tom said 

 dont ask for it unless you want it peter 

but peter signified that he did want it 

 you better make sure 

peter was sure 

 now youve asked for it and ill give it to you because there aint
anything mean about me but if you find you dont like it you mustnt
blame anybody but your own self 

peter was agreeable so tom pried his mouth open and poured down the
pain killer peter sprang a couple of yards in the air and then
delivered a war whoop and set off round and round the room banging
against furniture upsetting flower pots and making general havoc 
next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around in a frenzy of
enjoyment with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming
his unappeasable happiness then he went tearing around the house again
spreading chaos and destruction in his path aunt polly entered in time
to see him throw a few double summersets deliver a final mighty
hurrah and sail through the open window carrying the rest of the
flower pots with him the old lady stood petrified with astonishment 
peering over her glasses tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter 

 tom what on earth ails that cat 

 i dont know aunt gasped the boy 

 why i never see anything like it what did make him act so 

 deed i dont know aunt polly cats always act so when theyre having
a good time 

 they do do they there was something in the tone that made tom
apprehensive 

 yesm that is i believe they do 

 you do 

 yesm 

the old lady was bending down tom watching with interest emphasized
by anxiety too late he divined her drift the handle of the telltale
teaspoon was visible under the bed valance aunt polly took it held it
up tom winced and dropped his eyes aunt polly raised him by the
usual handle his ear and cracked his head soundly with her thimble 

 now sir what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so for 

 i done it out of pity for him because he hadnt any aunt 

 hadnt any aunt you numskull what has that got to do with it 

 heaps because if hed had one shed a burnt him out herself shed a
roasted his bowels out of him thout any more feeling than if he was a
human 

aunt polly felt a sudden pang of remorse this was putting the thing
in a new light what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy 
too she began to soften she felt sorry her eyes watered a little 
and she put her hand on toms head and said gently 

 i was meaning for the best tom and tom it did do you good 

tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
through his gravity 

 i know you was meaning for the best aunty and so was i with peter 
it done him good too i never see him get around so since 

 oh go long with you tom before you aggravate me again and you
try and see if you cant be a good boy for once and you neednt take
any more medicine 

tom reached school ahead of time it was noticed that this strange
thing had been occurring every day latterly and now as usual of late 
he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
comrades he was sick he said and he looked it he tried to seem to
be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking down the road 
presently jeff thatcher hove in sight and toms face lighted he gazed
a moment and then turned sorrowfully away when jeff arrived tom
accosted him and led up warily to opportunities for remark about
becky but the giddy lad never could see the bait tom watched and
watched hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight and hating the
owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one at last frocks
ceased to appear and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps he entered
the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer then one more frock
passed in at the gate and toms heart gave a great bound the next
instant he was out and going on like an indian yelling laughing 
chasing boys jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb throwing
handsprings standing on his head doing all the heroic things he could
conceive of and keeping a furtive eye out all the while to see if
becky thatcher was noticing but she seemed to be unconscious of it
all she never looked could it be possible that she was not aware that
he was there he carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity came
war whooping around snatched a boys cap hurled it to the roof of the
schoolhouse broke through a group of boys tumbling them in every
direction and fell sprawling himself under beckys nose almost
upsetting her and she turned with her nose in the air and he heard
her say mf some people think theyre mighty smart always showing
off 

toms cheeks burned he gathered himself up and sneaked off crushed
and crestfallen 



chapter xiii

toms mind was made up now he was gloomy and desperate he was a
forsaken friendless boy he said nobody loved him when they found
out what they had driven him to perhaps they would be sorry he had
tried to do right and get along but they would not let him since
nothing would do them but to be rid of him let it be so and let them
blame him for the consequences why shouldnt they what right had the
friendless to complain yes they had forced him to it at last he
would lead a life of crime there was no choice 

by this time he was far down meadow lane and the bell for school to
 take up tinkled faintly upon his ear he sobbed now to think he
should never never hear that old familiar sound any more it was very
hard but it was forced on him since he was driven out into the cold
world he must submit but he forgave them then the sobs came thick
and fast 

just at this point he met his souls sworn comrade joe harper
 hard eyed and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart 
plainly here were two souls with but a single thought tom wiping
his eyes with his sleeve began to blubber out something about a
resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
roaming abroad into the great world never to return and ended by
hoping that joe would not forget him 

but it transpired that this was a request which joe had just been
going to make of tom and had come to hunt him up for that purpose his
mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never
tasted and knew nothing about it was plain that she was tired of him
and wished him to go if she felt that way there was nothing for him
to do but succumb he hoped she would be happy and never regret having
driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die 

as the two boys walked sorrowing along they made a new compact to
stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death
relieved them of their troubles then they began to lay their plans 
joe was for being a hermit and living on crusts in a remote cave and
dying some time of cold and want and grief but after listening to
tom he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a
life of crime and so he consented to be a pirate 

three miles below st petersburg at a point where the mississippi
river was a trifle over a mile wide there was a long narrow wooded
island with a shallow bar at the head of it and this offered well as
a rendezvous it was not inhabited it lay far over toward the further
shore abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest so jacksons
island was chosen who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
matter that did not occur to them then they hunted up huckleberry
finn and he joined them promptly for all careers were one to him he
was indifferent they presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on
the river bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour which
was midnight there was a small log raft there which they meant to
capture each would bring hooks and lines and such provision as he
could steal in the most dark and mysterious way as became outlaws and
before the afternoon was done they had all managed to enjoy the sweet
glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would hear
something all who got this vague hint were cautioned to be mum and
wait 

about midnight tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles 
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting place it was starlight and very still the mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest tom listened a moment but no sound disturbed the
quiet then he gave a low distinct whistle it was answered from under
the bluff tom whistled twice more these signals were answered in the
same way then a guarded voice said 

 who goes there 

 tom sawyer the black avenger of the spanish main name your names 

 huck finn the red handed and joe harper the terror of the seas tom
had furnished these titles from his favorite literature 

 tis well give the countersign 

two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to
the brooding night 

 blood 

then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it 
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort there was
an easy comfortable path along the shore under the bluff but it
lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate 

the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon and had about worn
himself out with getting it there finn the red handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half cured leaf tobacco and had also brought
a few corn cobs to make pipes with but none of the pirates smoked or
 chewed but himself the black avenger of the spanish main said it
would never do to start without some fire that was a wise thought 
matches were hardly known there in that day they saw a fire
smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above and they went
stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk they made an
imposing adventure of it saying hist every now and then and
suddenly halting with finger on lip moving with hands on imaginary
dagger hilts and giving orders in dismal whispers that if the foe 
stirred to let him have it to the hilt because dead men tell no
tales they knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the
village laying in stores or having a spree but still that was no
excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way 

they shoved off presently tom in command huck at the after oar and
joe at the forward tom stood amidships gloomy browed and with folded
arms and gave his orders in a low stern whisper 

 luff and bring her to the wind 

 aye aye sir 

 steady steady y y y 

 steady it is sir 

 let her go off a point 

 point it is sir 

as the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid stream
it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
 style and were not intended to mean anything in particular 

 what sails she carrying 

 courses topsls and flying jib sir 

 send the ryals up lay out aloft there half a dozen of ye
 foretopmaststunsl lively now 

 aye aye sir 

 shake out that maintogalansl sheets and braces now my hearties 

 aye aye sir 

 hellum a lee hard a port stand by to meet her when she comes port 
port now men with a will stead y y y 

 steady it is sir 

the raft drew beyond the middle of the river the boys pointed her
head right and then lay on their oars the river was not high so
there was not more than a two or three mile current hardly a word was
said during the next three quarters of an hour now the raft was
passing before the distant town two or three glimmering lights showed
where it lay peacefully sleeping beyond the vague vast sweep of
star gemmed water unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening 
the black avenger stood still with folded arms looking his last upon
the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings and wishing
 she could see him now abroad on the wild sea facing peril and death
with dauntless heart going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips 
it was but a small strain on his imagination to remove jacksons island
beyond eyeshot of the village and so he looked his last with a
broken and satisfied heart the other pirates were looking their last 
too and they all looked so long that they came near letting the
current drift them out of the range of the island but they discovered
the danger in time and made shift to avert it about two oclock in
the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the
head of the island and they waded back and forth until they had landed
their freight part of the little rafts belongings consisted of an old
sail and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to
shelter their provisions but they themselves would sleep in the open
air in good weather as became outlaws 

they built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty
steps within the sombre depths of the forest and then cooked some
bacon in the frying pan for supper and used up half of the corn pone 
stock they had brought it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that
wild free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited
island far from the haunts of men and they said they never would
return to civilization the climbing fire lit up their faces and threw
its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree trunks of their forest temple 
and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines 

when the last crisp slice of bacon was gone and the last allowance of
corn pone devoured the boys stretched themselves out on the grass 
filled with contentment they could have found a cooler place but they
would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
camp fire 

 aint it gay said joe 

 its nuts said tom what would the boys say if they could see us 

 say well theyd just die to be here hey hucky 

 i reckon so said huckleberry anyways im suited i dont want
nothing bettern this i dont ever get enough to eat genally and
here they cant come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so 

 its just the life for me said tom you dont have to get up 
mornings and you dont have to go to school and wash and all that
blame foolishness you see a pirate dont have to do anything joe 
when hes ashore but a hermit he has to be praying considerable and
then he dont have any fun anyway all by himself that way 

 oh yes thats so said joe but i hadnt thought much about it 
you know id a good deal rather be a pirate now that ive tried it 

 you see said tom people dont go much on hermits nowadays like
they used to in old times but a pirates always respected and a
hermits got to sleep on the hardest place he can find and put
sackcloth and ashes on his head and stand out in the rain and 

 what does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for inquired huck 

 i dono but theyve got to do it hermits always do youd have to do
that if you was a hermit 

 dernd if i would said huck 

 well what would you do 

 i dono but i wouldnt do that 

 why huck youd have to howd you get around it 

 why i just wouldnt stand it id run away 

 run away well you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit youd be
a disgrace 

the red handed made no response being better employed he had
finished gouging out a cob and now he fitted a weed stem to it loaded
it with tobacco and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a
cloud of fragrant smoke he was in the full bloom of luxurious
contentment the other pirates envied him this majestic vice and
secretly resolved to acquire it shortly presently huck said 

 what does pirates have to do 

tom said 

 oh they have just a bully time take ships and burn them and get
the money and bury it in awful places in their island where theres
ghosts and things to watch it and kill everybody in the ships make
em walk a plank 

 and they carry the women to the island said joe they dont kill
the women 

 no assented tom they dont kill the women theyre too noble and
the womens always beautiful too 

 and dont they wear the bulliest clothes oh no all gold and silver
and dimonds said joe with enthusiasm 

 who said huck 

 why the pirates 

huck scanned his own clothing forlornly 

 i reckon i aint dressed fitten for a pirate said he with a
regretful pathos in his voice but i aint got none but these 

but the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough 
after they should have begun their adventures they made him understand
that his poor rags would do to begin with though it was customary for
wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe 

gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs the pipe dropped from the fingers of the
red handed and he slept the sleep of the conscience free and the
weary the terror of the seas and the black avenger of the spanish main
had more difficulty in getting to sleep they said their prayers
inwardly and lying down since there was nobody there with authority
to make them kneel and recite aloud in truth they had a mind not to
say them at all but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as
that lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from
heaven then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge
of sleep but an intruder came now that would not down it was
conscience they began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing
wrong to run away and next they thought of the stolen meat and then
the real torture came they tried to argue it away by reminding
conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of
times but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin
plausibilities it seemed to them in the end that there was no
getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only
 hooking while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain
simple stealing and there was a command against that in the bible so
they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business 
their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing 
then conscience granted a truce and these curiously inconsistent
pirates fell peacefully to sleep 



chapter xiv

when tom awoke in the morning he wondered where he was he sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked around then he comprehended it was the
cool gray dawn and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in
the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods not a leaf stirred 
not a sound obtruded upon great natures meditation beaded dewdrops
stood upon the leaves and grasses a white layer of ashes covered the
fire and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air joe
and huck still slept 

now far away in the woods a bird called another answered presently
the hammering of a woodpecker was heard gradually the cool dim gray of
the morning whitened and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
manifested itself the marvel of nature shaking off sleep and going to
work unfolded itself to the musing boy a little green worm came
crawling over a dewy leaf lifting two thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and sniffing around then proceeding again for he
was measuring tom said and when the worm approached him of its own
accord he sat as still as a stone with his hopes rising and falling 
by turns as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go elsewhere and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon toms leg and
began a journey over him his whole heart was glad for that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of clothes without the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical uniform now a procession of ants appeared 
from nowhere in particular and went about their labors one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms 
and lugged it straight up a tree trunk a brown spotted lady bug
climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade and tom bent down close to
it and said lady bug lady bug fly away home your house is on fire 
your childrens alone and she took wing and went off to see about it
 which did not surprise the boy for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations and he had practised upon its
simplicity more than once a tumblebug came next heaving sturdily at
its ball and tom touched the creature to see it shut its legs against
its body and pretend to be dead the birds were fairly rioting by this
time a catbird the northern mocker lit in a tree over toms head 
and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of
enjoyment then a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame and
stopped on a twig almost within the boys reach cocked his head to one
side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity a gray squirrel
and a big fellow of the fox kind came skurrying along sitting up at
intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys for the wild things had
probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to
be afraid or not all nature was wide awake and stirring now long
lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near 
and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene 

tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a
shout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
sandbar they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
distance beyond the majestic waste of water a vagrant current or a
slight rise in the river had carried off their raft but this only
gratified them since its going was something like burning the bridge
between them and civilization 

they came back to camp wonderfully refreshed glad hearted and
ravenous and they soon had the camp fire blazing up again huck found
a spring of clear cold water close by and the boys made cups of broad
oak or hickory leaves and felt that water sweetened with such a
wildwood charm as that would be a good enough substitute for coffee 
while joe was slicing bacon for breakfast tom and huck asked him to
hold on a minute they stepped to a promising nook in the river bank
and threw in their lines almost immediately they had reward joe had
not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some
handsome bass a couple of sun perch and a small catfish provisions
enough for quite a family they fried the fish with the bacon and were
astonished for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before they did
not know that the quicker a fresh water fish is on the fire after he is
caught the better he is and they reflected little upon what a sauce
open air sleeping open air exercise bathing and a large ingredient
of hunger make too 

they lay around in the shade after breakfast while huck had a smoke 
and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition they
tramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrush 
among solemn monarchs of the forest hung from their crowns to the
ground with a drooping regalia of grape vines now and then they came
upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers 

they found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to be
astonished at they discovered that the island was about three miles
long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest to
was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
wide they took a swim about every hour so it was close upon the
middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp they were too
hungry to stop to fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham and
then threw themselves down in the shade to talk but the talk soon
began to drag and then died the stillness the solemnity that brooded
in the woods and the sense of loneliness began to tell upon the
spirits of the boys they fell to thinking a sort of undefined longing
crept upon them this took dim shape presently it was budding
homesickness even finn the red handed was dreaming of his doorsteps
and empty hogsheads but they were all ashamed of their weakness and
none was brave enough to speak his thought 

for some time now the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
sound in the distance just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
clock which he takes no distinct note of but now this mysterious sound
became more pronounced and forced a recognition the boys started 
glanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude 
there was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullen
boom came floating down out of the distance 

 what is it exclaimed joe under his breath 

 i wonder said tom in a whisper 

 taint thunder said huckleberry in an awed tone becuz thunder 

 hark said tom listen dont talk 

they waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boom
troubled the solemn hush 

 lets go and see 

they sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town 
they parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water the
little steam ferryboat was about a mile below the village drifting
with the current her broad deck seemed crowded with people there were
a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the
neighborhood of the ferryboat but the boys could not determine what
the men in them were doing presently a great jet of white smoke burst
from the ferryboats side and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud 
that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again 

 i know now exclaimed tom somebodys drownded 

 thats it said huck they done that last summer when bill turner
got drownded they shoot a cannon over the water and that makes him
come up to the top yes and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in em and set em afloat and wherever theres anybody
thats drownded theyll float right there and stop 

 yes ive heard about that said joe i wonder what makes the bread
do that 

 oh it aint the bread so much said tom i reckon its mostly
what they say over it before they start it out 

 but they dont say anything over it said huck ive seen em and
they dont 

 well thats funny said tom but maybe they say it to themselves 
of course they do anybody might know that 

the other boys agreed that there was reason in what tom said because
an ignorant lump of bread uninstructed by an incantation could not be
expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
gravity 

 by jings i wish i was over there now said joe 

 i do too said huck id give heaps to know who it is 

the boys still listened and watched presently a revealing thought
flashed through toms mind and he exclaimed 

 boys i know whos drownded its us 

they felt like heroes in an instant here was a gorgeous triumph they
were missed they were mourned hearts were breaking on their account 
tears were being shed accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
lost lads were rising up and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
indulged and best of all the departed were the talk of the whole
town and the envy of all the boys as far as this dazzling notoriety
was concerned this was fine it was worth while to be a pirate after
all 

as twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustomed
business and the skiffs disappeared the pirates returned to camp they
were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious
trouble they were making they caught fish cooked supper and ate it 
and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying
about them and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their
account were gratifying to look upon from their point of view but
when the shadows of night closed them in they gradually ceased to
talk and sat gazing into the fire with their minds evidently
wandering elsewhere the excitement was gone now and tom and joe
could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not
enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were misgivings came they
grew troubled and unhappy a sigh or two escaped unawares by and by
joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout feeler as to how the others
might look upon a return to civilization not right now but 

tom withered him with derision huck being uncommitted as yet joined
in with tom and the waverer quickly explained and was glad to get
out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken hearted homesickness
clinging to his garments as he could mutiny was effectually laid to
rest for the moment 

as the night deepened huck began to nod and presently to snore joe
followed next tom lay upon his elbow motionless for some time 
watching the two intently at last he got up cautiously on his knees 
and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
by the camp fire he picked up and inspected several large
semi cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore and finally chose
two which seemed to suit him then he knelt by the fire and painfully
wrote something upon each of these with his red keel one he rolled up
and put in his jacket pocket and the other he put in joes hat and
removed it to a little distance from the owner and he also put into the
hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value among them
a lump of chalk an india rubber ball three fishhooks and one of that
kind of marbles known as a sure nough crystal then he tiptoed his
way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing 
and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar 



chapter xv

a few minutes later tom was in the shoal water of the bar wading
toward the illinois shore before the depth reached his middle he was
half way over the current would permit no more wading now so he
struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards he swam
quartering upstream but still was swept downward rather faster than he
had expected however he reached the shore finally and drifted along
till he found a low place and drew himself out he put his hand on his
jacket pocket found his piece of bark safe and then struck through
the woods following the shore with streaming garments shortly before
ten oclock he came out into an open place opposite the village and
saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank 
everything was quiet under the blinking stars he crept down the bank 
watching with all his eyes slipped into the water swam three or four
strokes and climbed into the skiff that did yawl duty at the boats
stern he laid himself down under the thwarts and waited panting 

presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to cast
off a minute or two later the skiffs head was standing high up 
against the boats swell and the voyage was begun tom felt happy in
his success for he knew it was the boats last trip for the night at
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped and tom
slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk landing fifty yards
downstream out of danger of possible stragglers 

he flew along unfrequented alleys and shortly found himself at his
aunts back fence he climbed over approached the ell and looked in
at the sitting room window for a light was burning there there sat
aunt polly sid mary and joe harpers mother grouped together 
talking they were by the bed and the bed was between them and the
door tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch then he
pressed gently and the door yielded a crack he continued pushing
cautiously and quaking every time it creaked till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees so he put his head through and began 
warily 

 what makes the candle blow so said aunt polly tom hurried up 
 why that doors open i believe why of course it is no end of
strange things now go long and shut it sid 

tom disappeared under the bed just in time he lay and breathed 
himself for a time and then crept to where he could almost touch his
aunts foot 

 but as i was saying said aunt polly he warnt bad so to say
 only mischeevous only just giddy and harum scarum you know he
warnt any more responsible than a colt he never meant any harm and
he was the best hearted boy that ever was and she began to cry 

 it was just so with my joe always full of his devilment and up to
every kind of mischief but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
could be and laws bless me to think i went and whipped him for taking
that cream never once recollecting that i throwed it out myself
because it was sour and i never to see him again in this world never 
never never poor abused boy and mrs harper sobbed as if her heart
would break 

 i hope toms better off where he is said sid but if hed been
better in some ways 

 sid tom felt the glare of the old ladys eye though he could not
see it not a word against my tom now that hes gone godll take
care of him never you trouble yourself sir oh mrs harper i dont
know how to give him up i dont know how to give him up he was such a
comfort to me although he tormented my old heart out of me most 

 the lord giveth and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of
the lord but its so hard oh its so hard only last saturday my
joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and i knocked him
sprawling little did i know then how soon oh if it was to do over
again id hug him and bless him for it 

 yes yes yes i know just how you feel mrs harper i know just
exactly how you feel no longer ago than yesterday noon my tom took
and filled the cat full of pain killer and i did think the cretur
would tear the house down and god forgive me i cracked toms head
with my thimble poor boy poor dead boy but hes out of all his
troubles now and the last words i ever heard him say was to reproach 

but this memory was too much for the old lady and she broke entirely
down tom was snuffling now himself and more in pity of himself than
anybody else he could hear mary crying and putting in a kindly word
for him from time to time he began to have a nobler opinion of himself
than ever before still he was sufficiently touched by his aunts
grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with
joy and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to
his nature too but he resisted and lay still 

he went on listening and gathered by odds and ends that it was
conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim 
then the small raft had been missed next certain boys said the
missing lads had promised that the village should hear something 
soon the wise heads had put this and that together and decided that
the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town
below presently but toward noon the raft had been found lodged
against the missouri shore some five or six miles below the village
 and then hope perished they must be drowned else hunger would have
driven them home by nightfall if not sooner it was believed that the
search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the
drowning must have occurred in mid channel since the boys being good
swimmers would otherwise have escaped to shore this was wednesday
night if the bodies continued missing until sunday all hope would be
given over and the funerals would be preached on that morning tom
shuddered 

mrs harper gave a sobbing good night and turned to go then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each
others arms and had a good consoling cry and then parted aunt polly
was tender far beyond her wont in her good night to sid and mary sid
snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart 

aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly so
appealingly and with such measureless love in her words and her old
trembling voice that he was weltering in tears again long before she
was through 

he had to keep still long after she went to bed for she kept making
broken hearted ejaculations from time to time tossing unrestfully and
turning over but at last she was still only moaning a little in her
sleep now the boy stole out rose gradually by the bedside shaded the
candle light with his hand and stood regarding her his heart was full
of pity for her he took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
candle but something occurred to him and he lingered considering his
face lighted with a happy solution of his thought he put the bark
hastily in his pocket then he bent over and kissed the faded lips and
straightway made his stealthy exit latching the door behind him 

he threaded his way back to the ferry landing found nobody at large
there and walked boldly on board the boat for he knew she was
tenantless except that there was a watchman who always turned in and
slept like a graven image he untied the skiff at the stern slipped
into it and was soon rowing cautiously upstream when he had pulled a
mile above the village he started quartering across and bent himself
stoutly to his work he hit the landing on the other side neatly for
this was a familiar bit of work to him he was moved to capture the
skiff arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
legitimate prey for a pirate but he knew a thorough search would be
made for it and that might end in revelations so he stepped ashore and
entered the woods 

he sat down and took a long rest torturing himself meanwhile to keep
awake and then started warily down the home stretch the night was far
spent it was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
island bar he rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
great river with its splendor and then he plunged into the stream a
little later he paused dripping upon the threshold of the camp and
heard joe say 

 no toms true blue huck and hell come back he wont desert he
knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate and toms too proud for
that sort of thing hes up to something or other now i wonder what 

 well the things is ours anyway aint they 

 pretty near but not yet huck the writing says they are if he aint
back here to breakfast 

 which he is exclaimed tom with fine dramatic effect stepping
grandly into camp 

a sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided and as
the boys set to work upon it tom recounted and adorned his
adventures they were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the
tale was done then tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till
noon and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore 



chapter xvi

after dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the
bar they went about poking sticks into the sand and when they found a
soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands 
sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole they
were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an english
walnut they had a famous fried egg feast that night and another on
friday morning 

after breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar and
chased each other round and round shedding clothes as they went until
they were naked and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal
water of the bar against the stiff current which latter tripped their
legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun 
and now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each
others faces with their palms gradually approaching each other with
averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays and finally gripping and
struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor and then they all
went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing 
sputtering laughing and gasping for breath at one and the same time 

when they were well exhausted they would run out and sprawl on the
dry hot sand and lie there and cover themselves up with it and by
and by break for the water again and go through the original
performance once more finally it occurred to them that their naked
skin represented flesh colored tights very fairly so they drew a
ring in the sand and had a circus with three clowns in it for none
would yield this proudest post to his neighbor 

next they got their marbles and played knucks and ring taw and
 keeps till that amusement grew stale then joe and huck had another
swim but tom would not venture because he found that in kicking off
his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his
ankle and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the
protection of this mysterious charm he did not venture again until he
had found it and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to
rest they gradually wandered apart dropped into the dumps and fell
to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay
drowsing in the sun tom found himself writing becky in the sand with
his big toe he scratched it out and was angry with himself for his
weakness but he wrote it again nevertheless he could not help it he
erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving
the other boys together and joining them 

but joes spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection he was so
homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it the tears lay
very near the surface huck was melancholy too tom was downhearted 
but tried hard not to show it he had a secret which he was not ready
to tell yet but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon 
he would have to bring it out he said with a great show of
cheerfulness 

 i bet theres been pirates on this island before boys well explore
it again theyve hid treasures here somewhere howd you feel to light
on a rotten chest full of gold and silver hey 

but it roused only faint enthusiasm which faded out with no reply 
tom tried one or two other seductions but they failed too it was
discouraging work joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking
very gloomy finally he said 

 oh boys lets give it up i want to go home its so lonesome 

 oh no joe youll feel better by and by said tom just think of
the fishing thats here 

 i dont care for fishing i want to go home 

 but joe there aint such another swimming place anywhere 

 swimmings no good i dont seem to care for it somehow when there
aint anybody to say i shant go in i mean to go home 

 oh shucks baby you want to see your mother i reckon 

 yes i do want to see my mother and you would too if you had one 
i aint any more baby than you are and joe snuffled a little 

 well well let the cry baby go home to his mother wont we huck 
poor thing does it want to see its mother and so it shall you like
it here dont you huck well stay wont we 

huck said y e s without any heart in it 

 ill never speak to you again as long as i live said joe rising 
 there now and he moved moodily away and began to dress himself 

 who cares said tom nobody wants you to go long home and get
laughed at oh youre a nice pirate huck and me aint cry babies 
well stay wont we huck let him go if he wants to i reckon we can
get along without him peraps 

but tom was uneasy nevertheless and was alarmed to see joe go
sullenly on with his dressing and then it was discomforting to see
huck eying joes preparations so wistfully and keeping up such an
ominous silence presently without a parting word joe began to wade
off toward the illinois shore toms heart began to sink he glanced at
huck huck could not bear the look and dropped his eyes then he said 

 i want to go too tom it was getting so lonesome anyway and now
itll be worse lets us go too tom 

 i wont you can all go if you want to i mean to stay 

 tom i better go 

 well go long whos hendering you 

huck began to pick up his scattered clothes he said 

 tom i wisht youd come too now you think it over well wait for
you when we get to shore 

 well youll wait a blame long time thats all 

huck started sorrowfully away and tom stood looking after him with a
strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too 
he hoped the boys would stop but they still waded slowly on it
suddenly dawned on tom that it was become very lonely and still he
made one final struggle with his pride and then darted after his
comrades yelling 

 wait wait i want to tell you something 

they presently stopped and turned around when he got to where they
were he began unfolding his secret and they listened moodily till at
last they saw the point he was driving at and then they set up a
war whoop of applause and said it was splendid and said if he had
told them at first they wouldnt have started away he made a plausible
excuse but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret
would keep them with him any very great length of time and so he had
meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction 

the lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will 
chattering all the time about toms stupendous plan and admiring the
genius of it after a dainty egg and fish dinner tom said he wanted to
learn to smoke now joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
try too so huck made pipes and filled them these novices had never
smoked anything before but cigars made of grape vine and they bit 
the tongue and were not considered manly anyway 

now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff 
charily and with slender confidence the smoke had an unpleasant
taste and they gagged a little but tom said 

 why its just as easy if id a knowed this was all id a learnt
long ago 

 so would i said joe its just nothing 

 why many a time ive looked at people smoking and thought well i
wish i could do that but i never thought i could said tom 

 thats just the way with me haint it huck youve heard me talk
just that way havent you huck ill leave it to huck if i havent 

 yes heaps of times said huck 

 well i have too said tom oh hundreds of times once down by the
slaughter house dont you remember huck bob tanner was there and
johnny miller and jeff thatcher when i said it dont you remember 
huck bout me saying that 

 yes thats so said huck that was the day after i lost a white
alley no twas the day before 

 there i told you so said tom huck recollects it 

 i bleeve i could smoke this pipe all day said joe i dont feel
sick 

 neither do i said tom i could smoke it all day but i bet you
jeff thatcher couldnt 

 jeff thatcher why hed keel over just with two draws just let him
try it once hed see 

 i bet he would and johnny miller i wish could see johnny miller
tackle it once 

 oh dont i said joe why i bet you johnny miller couldnt any
more do this than nothing just one little snifter would fetch him 

 deed it would joe say i wish the boys could see us now 

 so do i 

 say boys dont say anything about it and some time when theyre
around ill come up to you and say joe got a pipe i want a smoke 
and youll say kind of careless like as if it warnt anything youll
say yes i got my old pipe and another one but my tobacker aint
very good and ill say oh thats all right if its strong
enough and then youll out with the pipes and well light up just as
cam and then just see em look 

 by jings thatll be gay tom i wish it was now 

 so do i and when we tell em we learned when we was off pirating 
wont they wish theyd been along 

 oh i reckon not ill just bet they will 

so the talk ran on but presently it began to flag a trifle and grow
disjointed the silences widened the expectoration marvellously
increased every pore inside the boys cheeks became a spouting
fountain they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
fast enough to prevent an inundation little overflowings down their
throats occurred in spite of all they could do and sudden retchings
followed every time both boys were looking very pale and miserable 
now joes pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers toms followed 
both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might
and main joe said feebly 

 ive lost my knife i reckon i better go and find it 

tom said with quivering lips and halting utterance 

 ill help you you go over that way and ill hunt around by the
spring no you neednt come huck we can find it 

so huck sat down again and waited an hour then he found it lonesome 
and went to find his comrades they were wide apart in the woods both
very pale both fast asleep but something informed him that if they
had had any trouble they had got rid of it 

they were not talkative at supper that night they had a humble look 
and when huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare
theirs they said no they were not feeling very well something they
ate at dinner had disagreed with them 

about midnight joe awoke and called the boys there was a brooding
oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something the boys
huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of
the fire though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was
stifling they sat still intent and waiting the solemn hush
continued beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in
the blackness of darkness presently there came a quivering glow that
vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished by and by
another came a little stronger then another then a faint moan came
sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting
breath upon their cheeks and shuddered with the fancy that the spirit
of the night had gone by there was a pause now a weird flash turned
night into day and showed every little grass blade separate and
distinct that grew about their feet and it showed three white 
startled faces too a deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling
down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance a
sweep of chilly air passed by rustling all the leaves and snowing the
flaky ashes broadcast about the fire another fierce glare lit up the
forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree tops
right over the boys heads they clung together in terror in the thick
gloom that followed a few big rain drops fell pattering upon the
leaves 

 quick boys go for the tent exclaimed tom 

they sprang away stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark no
two plunging in the same direction a furious blast roared through the
trees making everything sing as it went one blinding flash after
another came and peal on peal of deafening thunder and now a
drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets
along the ground the boys cried out to each other but the roaring
wind and the booming thunder blasts drowned their voices utterly 
however one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under
the tent cold scared and streaming with water but to have company
in misery seemed something to be grateful for they could not talk the
old sail flapped so furiously even if the other noises would have
allowed them the tempest rose higher and higher and presently the
sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast 
the boys seized each others hands and fled with many tumblings and
bruises to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river bank 
now the battle was at its highest under the ceaseless conflagration of
lightning that flamed in the skies everything below stood out in
clean cut and shadowless distinctness the bending trees the billowy
river white with foam the driving spray of spume flakes the dim
outlines of the high bluffs on the other side glimpsed through the
drifting cloud rack and the slanting veil of rain every little while
some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger
growth and the unflagging thunder peals came now in ear splitting
explosive bursts keen and sharp and unspeakably appalling the storm
culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island
to pieces burn it up drown it to the tree tops blow it away and
deafen every creature in it all at one and the same moment it was a
wild night for homeless young heads to be out in 

but at last the battle was done and the forces retired with weaker
and weaker threatenings and grumblings and peace resumed her sway the
boys went back to camp a good deal awed but they found there was
still something to be thankful for because the great sycamore the
shelter of their beds was a ruin now blasted by the lightnings and
they were not under it when the catastrophe happened 

everything in camp was drenched the camp fire as well for they were
but heedless lads like their generation and had made no provision
against rain here was matter for dismay for they were soaked through
and chilled they were eloquent in their distress but they presently
discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had
been built against where it curved upward and separated itself from
the ground that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting so
they patiently wrought until with shreds and bark gathered from the
under sides of sheltered logs they coaxed the fire to burn again then
they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace and
were glad hearted once more they dried their boiled ham and had a
feast and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified
their midnight adventure until morning for there was not a dry spot to
sleep on anywhere around 

as the sun began to steal in upon the boys drowsiness came over them 
and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep they got
scorched out by and by and drearily set about getting breakfast after
the meal they felt rusty and stiff jointed and a little homesick once
more tom saw the signs and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as
he could but they cared nothing for marbles or circus or swimming 
or anything he reminded them of the imposing secret and raised a ray
of cheer while it lasted he got them interested in a new device this
was to knock off being pirates for a while and be indians for a
change they were attracted by this idea so it was not long before
they were stripped and striped from head to heel with black mud like
so many zebras all of them chiefs of course and then they went
tearing through the woods to attack an english settlement 

by and by they separated into three hostile tribes and darted upon
each other from ambush with dreadful war whoops and killed and scalped
each other by thousands it was a gory day consequently it was an
extremely satisfactory one 

they assembled in camp toward supper time hungry and happy but now a
difficulty arose hostile indians could not break the bread of
hospitality together without first making peace and this was a simple
impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace there was no other
process that ever they had heard of two of the savages almost wished
they had remained pirates however there was no other way so with
such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe
and took their whiff as it passed in due form 

and behold they were glad they had gone into savagery for they had
gained something they found that they could now smoke a little without
having to go and hunt for a lost knife they did not get sick enough to
be seriously uncomfortable they were not likely to fool away this high
promise for lack of effort no they practised cautiously after
supper with right fair success and so they spent a jubilant evening 
they were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would
have been in the scalping and skinning of the six nations we will
leave them to smoke and chatter and brag since we have no further use
for them at present 



chapter xvii

but there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil
saturday afternoon the harpers and aunt pollys family were being
put into mourning with great grief and many tears an unusual quiet
possessed the village although it was ordinarily quiet enough in all
conscience the villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air 
and talked little but they sighed often the saturday holiday seemed a
burden to the children they had no heart in their sports and
gradually gave them up 

in the afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about the
deserted schoolhouse yard and feeling very melancholy but she found
nothing there to comfort her she soliloquized 

 oh if i only had a brass andiron knob again but i havent got
anything now to remember him by and she choked back a little sob 

presently she stopped and said to herself 

 it was right here oh if it was to do over again i wouldnt say
that i wouldnt say it for the whole world but hes gone now ill
never never never see him any more 

this thought broke her down and she wandered away with tears rolling
down her cheeks then quite a group of boys and girls playmates of
toms and joes came by and stood looking over the paling fence and
talking in reverent tones of how tom did so and so the last time they
saw him and how joe said this and that small trifle pregnant with
awful prophecy as they could easily see now and each speaker
pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time and
then added something like and i was a standing just so just as i am
now and as if you was him i was as close as that and he smiled just
this way and then something seemed to go all over me like awful you
know and i never thought what it meant of course but i can see now 

then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life and
many claimed that dismal distinction and offered evidences more or
less tampered with by the witness and when it was ultimately decided
who did see the departed last and exchanged the last words with them 
the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance and
were gaped at and envied by all the rest one poor chap who had no
other grandeur to offer said with tolerably manifest pride in the
remembrance 

 well tom sawyer he licked me once 

but that bid for glory was a failure most of the boys could say that 
and so that cheapened the distinction too much the group loitered
away still recalling memories of the lost heroes in awed voices 

when the sunday school hour was finished the next morning the bell
began to toll instead of ringing in the usual way it was a very still
sabbath and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature the villagers began to gather loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event but there
was no whispering in the house only the funereal rustling of dresses
as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there none
could remember when the little church had been so full before there
was finally a waiting pause an expectant dumbness and then aunt polly
entered followed by sid and mary and they by the harper family all
in deep black and the whole congregation the old minister as well 
rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front
pew there was another communing silence broken at intervals by
muffled sobs and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed 
a moving hymn was sung and the text followed i am the resurrection
and the life 

as the service proceeded the clergyman drew such pictures of the
graces the winning ways and the rare promise of the lost lads that
every soul there thinking he recognized these pictures felt a pang in
remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
before and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
boys the minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
departed too which illustrated their sweet generous natures and the
people could easily see now how noble and beautiful those episodes
were and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
seemed rank rascalities well deserving of the cowhide the
congregation became more and more moved as the pathetic tale went on 
till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping
mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs the preacher himself giving way
to his feelings and crying in the pulpit 

there was a rustle in the gallery which nobody noticed a moment
later the church door creaked the minister raised his streaming eyes
above his handkerchief and stood transfixed first one and then
another pair of eyes followed the ministers and then almost with one
impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came
marching up the aisle tom in the lead joe next and huck a ruin of
drooping rags sneaking sheepishly in the rear they had been hid in
the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon 

aunt polly mary and the harpers threw themselves upon their restored
ones smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings while
poor huck stood abashed and uncomfortable not knowing exactly what to
do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes he wavered and
started to slink away but tom seized him and said 

 aunt polly it aint fair somebodys got to be glad to see huck 

 and so they shall im glad to see him poor motherless thing and
the loving attentions aunt polly lavished upon him were the one thing
capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before 

suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice praise god
from whom all blessings flow sing and put your hearts in it 

and they did old hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst and
while it shook the rafters tom sawyer the pirate looked around upon the
envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was
the proudest moment of his life 

as the sold congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
willing to be made ridiculous again to hear old hundred sung like that
once more 

tom got more cuffs and kisses that day according to aunt pollys
varying moods than he had earned before in a year and he hardly knew
which expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for himself 



chapter xviii

that was toms great secret the scheme to return home with his
brother pirates and attend their own funerals they had paddled over to
the missouri shore on a log at dusk on saturday landing five or six
miles below the village they had slept in the woods at the edge of the
town till nearly daylight and had then crept through back lanes and
alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a
chaos of invalided benches 

at breakfast monday morning aunt polly and mary were very loving to
tom and very attentive to his wants there was an unusual amount of
talk in the course of it aunt polly said 

 well i dont say it wasnt a fine joke tom to keep everybody
suffering most a week so you boys had a good time but it is a pity
you could be so hard hearted as to let me suffer so if you could come
over on a log to go to your funeral you could have come over and give
me a hint some way that you warnt dead but only run off 

 yes you could have done that tom said mary and i believe you
would if you had thought of it 

 would you tom said aunt polly her face lighting wistfully say 
now would you if youd thought of it 

 i well i dont know twould a spoiled everything 

 tom i hoped you loved me that much said aunt polly with a grieved
tone that discomforted the boy it would have been something if youd
cared enough to think of it even if you didnt do it 

 now auntie that aint any harm pleaded mary its only toms
giddy way he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of
anything 

 mores the pity sid would have thought and sid would have come and
done it too tom youll look back some day when its too late and
wish youd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
little 

 now auntie you know i do care for you said tom 

 id know it better if you acted more like it 

 i wish now id thought said tom with a repentant tone but i
dreamt about you anyway thats something aint it 

 it aint much a cat does that much but its better than nothing 
what did you dream 

 why wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
bed and sid was sitting by the woodbox and mary next to him 

 well so we did so we always do im glad your dreams could take
even that much trouble about us 

 and i dreamt that joe harpers mother was here 

 why she was here did you dream any more 

 oh lots but its so dim now 

 well try to recollect cant you 

 somehow it seems to me that the wind the wind blowed the the 

 try harder tom the wind did blow something come 

tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute and then
said 

 ive got it now ive got it now it blowed the candle 

 mercy on us go on tom go on 

 and it seems to me that you said why i believe that that door 

 go on tom 

 just let me study a moment just a moment oh yes you said you
believed the door was open 

 as im sitting here i did didnt i mary go on 

 and then and then well i wont be certain but it seems like as if
you made sid go and and 

 well well what did i make him do tom what did i make him do 

 you made him you oh you made him shut it 

 well for the lands sake i never heard the beat of that in all my
days dont tell me there aint anything in dreams any more sereny
harper shall know of this before im an hour older id like to see her
get around this with her rubbage bout superstition go on tom 

 oh its all getting just as bright as day now next you said i
warnt bad only mischeevous and harum scarum and not any more
responsible than than i think it was a colt or something 

 and so it was well goodness gracious go on tom 

 and then you began to cry 

 so i did so i did not the first time neither and then 

 then mrs harper she began to cry and said joe was just the same 
and she wished she hadnt whipped him for taking cream when shed
throwed it out her own self 

 tom the sperrit was upon you you was a prophesying thats what you
was doing land alive go on tom 

 then sid he said he said 

 i dont think i said anything said sid 

 yes you did sid said mary 

 shut your heads and let tom go on what did he say tom 

 he said i think he said he hoped i was better off where i was gone
to but if id been better sometimes 

 there dyou hear that it was his very words 

 and you shut him up sharp 

 i lay i did there must a been an angel there there was an angel
there somewheres 

 and mrs harper told about joe scaring her with a firecracker and
you told about peter and the painkiller 

 just as true as i live 

 and then there was a whole lot of talk bout dragging the river for
us and bout having the funeral sunday and then you and old miss
harper hugged and cried and she went 

 it happened just so it happened just so as sure as im a sitting in
these very tracks tom you couldnt told it more like if youd a
seen it and then what go on tom 

 then i thought you prayed for me and i could see you and hear every
word you said and you went to bed and i was so sorry that i took and
wrote on a piece of sycamore bark we aint dead we are only off
being pirates and put it on the table by the candle and then you
looked so good laying there asleep that i thought i went and leaned
over and kissed you on the lips 

 did you tom did you i just forgive you everything for that and
she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
guiltiest of villains 

 it was very kind even though it was only a dream sid soliloquized
just audibly 

 shut up sid a body does just the same in a dream as hed do if he
was awake heres a big milum apple ive been saving for you tom if
you was ever found again now go long to school im thankful to the
good god and father of us all ive got you back thats long suffering
and merciful to them that believe on him and keep his word though
goodness knows im unworthy of it but if only the worthy ones got his
blessings and had his hand to help them over the rough places theres
few enough would smile here or ever enter into his rest when the long
night comes go long sid mary tom take yourselves off youve
hendered me long enough 

the children left for school and the old lady to call on mrs harper
and vanquish her realism with toms marvellous dream sid had better
judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
house it was this pretty thin as long a dream as that without any
mistakes in it 

what a hero tom was become now he did not go skipping and prancing 
but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
public eye was on him and indeed it was he tried not to seem to see
the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along but they were food
and drink to him smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels as
proud to be seen with him and tolerated by him as if he had been the
drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie
into town boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away
at all but they were consuming with envy nevertheless they would
have given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his and his
glittering notoriety and tom would not have parted with either for a
circus 

at school the children made so much of him and of joe and delivered
such eloquent admiration from their eyes that the two heroes were not
long in becoming insufferably stuck up they began to tell their
adventures to hungry listeners but they only began it was not a thing
likely to have an end with imaginations like theirs to furnish
material and finally when they got out their pipes and went serenely
puffing around the very summit of glory was reached 

tom decided that he could be independent of becky thatcher now glory
was sufficient he would live for glory now that he was distinguished 
maybe she would be wanting to make up well let her she should see
that he could be as indifferent as some other people presently she
arrived tom pretended not to see her he moved away and joined a group
of boys and girls and began to talk soon he observed that she was
tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes 
pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates and screaming with laughter
when she made a capture but he noticed that she always made her
captures in his vicinity and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
in his direction at such times too it gratified all the vicious
vanity that was in him and so instead of winning him it only set
him up the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that
he knew she was about presently she gave over skylarking and moved
irresolutely about sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
wistfully toward tom then she observed that now tom was talking more
particularly to amy lawrence than to any one else she felt a sharp
pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once she tried to go away but
her feet were treacherous and carried her to the group instead she
said to a girl almost at toms elbow with sham vivacity 

 why mary austin you bad girl why didnt you come to sunday school 

 i did come didnt you see me 

 why no did you where did you sit 

 i was in miss peters class where i always go i saw you 

 did you why its funny i didnt see you i wanted to tell you about
the picnic 

 oh thats jolly whos going to give it 

 my mas going to let me have one 

 oh goody i hope shell let me come 

 well she will the picnics for me shell let anybody come that i
want and i want you 

 thats ever so nice when is it going to be 

 by and by maybe about vacation 

 oh wont it be fun you going to have all the girls and boys 

 yes every one thats friends to me or wants to be and she glanced
ever so furtively at tom but he talked right along to amy lawrence
about the terrible storm on the island and how the lightning tore the
great sycamore tree all to flinders while he was standing within
three feet of it 

 oh may i come said grace miller 

 yes 

 and me said sally rogers 

 yes 

 and me too said susy harper and joe 

 yes 

and so on with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
for invitations but tom and amy then tom turned coolly away still
talking and took amy with him beckys lips trembled and the tears
came to her eyes she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
chattering but the life had gone out of the picnic now and out of
everything else she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
had what her sex call a good cry then she sat moody with wounded
pride till the bell rang she roused up now with a vindictive cast
in her eye and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
shed do 

at recess tom continued his flirtation with amy with jubilant
self satisfaction and he kept drifting about to find becky and lacerate
her with the performance at last he spied her but there was a sudden
falling of his mercury she was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture book with alfred temple and so
absorbed were they and their heads so close together over the book 
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides 
jealousy ran red hot through toms veins he began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance becky had offered for a reconciliation he
called himself a fool and all the hard names he could think of he
wanted to cry with vexation amy chatted happily along as they walked 
for her heart was singing but toms tongue had lost its function he
did not hear what amy was saying and whenever she paused expectantly he
could only stammer an awkward assent which was as often misplaced as
otherwise he kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse again and
again to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there he could
not help it and it maddened him to see as he thought he saw that
becky thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
living but she did see nevertheless and she knew she was winning her
fight too and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered 

amys happy prattle became intolerable tom hinted at things he had to
attend to things that must be done and time was fleeting but in
vain the girl chirped on tom thought oh hang her aint i ever
going to get rid of her at last he must be attending to those
things and she said artlessly that she would be around when school
let out and he hastened away hating her for it 

 any other boy tom thought grating his teeth any boy in the whole
town but that saint louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
aristocracy oh all right i licked you the first day you ever saw
this town mister and ill lick you again you just wait till i catch
you out ill just take and 

and he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy
 pummelling the air and kicking and gouging oh you do do you you
holler nough do you now then let that learn you and so the
imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction 

tom fled home at noon his conscience could not endure any more of
amys grateful happiness and his jealousy could bear no more of the
other distress becky resumed her picture inspections with alfred but
as the minutes dragged along and no tom came to suffer her triumph
began to cloud and she lost interest gravity and absent mindedness
followed and then melancholy two or three times she pricked up her
ear at a footstep but it was a false hope no tom came at last she
grew entirely miserable and wished she hadnt carried it so far when
poor alfred seeing that he was losing her he did not know how kept
exclaiming oh heres a jolly one look at this she lost patience
at last and said oh dont bother me i dont care for them and
burst into tears and got up and walked away 

alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her but she
said 

 go away and leave me alone cant you i hate you 

so the boy halted wondering what he could have done for she had said
she would look at pictures all through the nooning and she walked on 
crying then alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse he was
humiliated and angry he easily guessed his way to the truth the girl
had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon tom sawyer 
he was far from hating tom the less when this thought occurred to him 
he wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
risk to himself toms spelling book fell under his eye here was his
opportunity he gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
poured ink upon the page 

becky glancing in at a window behind him at the moment saw the act 
and moved on without discovering herself she started homeward now 
intending to find tom and tell him tom would be thankful and their
troubles would be healed before she was half way home however she
had changed her mind the thought of toms treatment of her when she
was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with
shame she resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged
spelling books account and to hate him forever into the bargain 



chapter xix

tom arrived at home in a dreary mood and the first thing his aunt
said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an
unpromising market 

 tom ive a notion to skin you alive 

 auntie what have i done 

 well youve done enough here i go over to sereny harper like an
old softy expecting im going to make her believe all that rubbage
about that dream when lo and behold you shed found out from joe that
you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night tom i
dont know what is to become of a boy that will act like that it makes
me feel so bad to think you could let me go to sereny harper and make
such a fool of myself and never say a word 

this was a new aspect of the thing his smartness of the morning had
seemed to tom a good joke before and very ingenious it merely looked
mean and shabby now he hung his head and could not think of anything
to say for a moment then he said 

 auntie i wish i hadnt done it but i didnt think 

 oh child you never think you never think of anything but your own
selfishness you could think to come all the way over here from
jacksons island in the night to laugh at our troubles and you could
think to fool me with a lie about a dream but you couldnt ever think
to pity us and save us from sorrow 

 auntie i know now it was mean but i didnt mean to be mean i
didnt honest and besides i didnt come over here to laugh at you
that night 

 what did you come for then 

 it was to tell you not to be uneasy about us because we hadnt got
drownded 

 tom tom i would be the thankfullest soul in this world if i could
believe you ever had as good a thought as that but you know you never
did and i know it tom 

 indeed and deed i did auntie i wish i may never stir if i didnt 

 oh tom dont lie dont do it it only makes things a hundred times
worse 

 it aint a lie auntie its the truth i wanted to keep you from
grieving that was all that made me come 

 id give the whole world to believe that it would cover up a power
of sins tom id most be glad youd run off and acted so bad but it
aint reasonable because why didnt you tell me child 

 why you see when you got to talking about the funeral i just got
all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church and i
couldnt somehow bear to spoil it so i just put the bark back in my
pocket and kept mum 

 what bark 

 the bark i had wrote on to tell you wed gone pirating i wish now 
youd waked up when i kissed you i do honest 

the hard lines in his aunts face relaxed and a sudden tenderness
dawned in her eyes 

 did you kiss me tom 

 why yes i did 

 are you sure you did tom 

 why yes i did auntie certain sure 

 what did you kiss me for tom 

 because i loved you so and you laid there moaning and i was so sorry 

the words sounded like truth the old lady could not hide a tremor in
her voice when she said 

 kiss me again tom and be off with you to school now and dont
bother me any more 

the moment he was gone she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
jacket which tom had gone pirating in then she stopped with it in her
hand and said to herself 

 no i dont dare poor boy i reckon hes lied about it but its a
blessed blessed lie theres such a comfort come from it i hope the
lord i know the lord will forgive him because it was such
goodheartedness in him to tell it but i dont want to find out its a
lie i wont look 

she put the jacket away and stood by musing a minute twice she put
out her hand to take the garment again and twice she refrained once
more she ventured and this time she fortified herself with the
thought its a good lie its a good lie i wont let it grieve me 
so she sought the jacket pocket a moment later she was reading toms
piece of bark through flowing tears and saying i could forgive the
boy now if hed committed a million sins 



chapter xx

there was something about aunt pollys manner when she kissed tom 
that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy
again he started to school and had the luck of coming upon becky
thatcher at the head of meadow lane his mood always determined his
manner without a moments hesitation he ran to her and said 

 i acted mighty mean to day becky and im so sorry i wont ever 
ever do that way again as long as ever i live please make up wont
you 

the girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face 

 ill thank you to keep yourself to yourself mr thomas sawyer ill
never speak to you again 

she tossed her head and passed on tom was so stunned that he had not
even presence of mind enough to say who cares miss smarty until the
right time to say it had gone by so he said nothing but he was in a
fine rage nevertheless he moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
a boy and imagining how he would trounce her if she were he presently
encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed she
hurled one in return and the angry breach was complete it seemed to
becky in her hot resentment that she could hardly wait for school to
 take in she was so impatient to see tom flogged for the injured
spelling book if she had had any lingering notion of exposing alfred
temple toms offensive fling had driven it entirely away 

poor girl she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself 
the master mr dobbins had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
ambition the darling of his desires was to be a doctor but poverty
had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
schoolmaster every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting he kept
that book under lock and key there was not an urchin in school but was
perishing to have a glimpse of it but the chance never came every boy
and girl had a theory about the nature of that book but no two
theories were alike and there was no way of getting at the facts in
the case now as becky was passing by the desk which stood near the
door she noticed that the key was in the lock it was a precious
moment she glanced around found herself alone and the next instant
she had the book in her hands the title page professor somebodys
anatomy carried no information to her mind so she began to turn the
leaves she came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored
frontispiece a human figure stark naked at that moment a shadow fell
on the page and tom sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse
of the picture becky snatched at the book to close it and had the
hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle she thrust
the volume into the desk turned the key and burst out crying with
shame and vexation 

 tom sawyer you are just as mean as you can be to sneak up on a
person and look at what theyre looking at 

 how could i know you was looking at anything 

 you ought to be ashamed of yourself tom sawyer you know youre
going to tell on me and oh what shall i do what shall i do ill be
whipped and i never was whipped in school 

then she stamped her little foot and said 

 be so mean if you want to i know something thats going to happen 
you just wait and youll see hateful hateful hateful and she
flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying 

tom stood still rather flustered by this onslaught presently he said
to himself 

 what a curious kind of a fool a girl is never been licked in school 
shucks whats a licking thats just like a girl theyre so
thin skinned and chicken hearted well of course i aint going to tell
old dobbins on this little fool because theres other ways of getting
even on her that aint so mean but what of it old dobbins will ask
who it was tore his book nobodyll answer then hell do just the way
he always does ask first one and then tother and when he comes to the
right girl hell know it without any telling girls faces always tell
on them they aint got any backbone shell get licked well its a
kind of a tight place for becky thatcher because there aint any way
out of it tom conned the thing a moment longer and then added all
right though shed like to see me in just such a fix let her sweat it
out 

tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside in a few moments
the master arrived and school took in tom did not feel a strong
interest in his studies every time he stole a glance at the girls
side of the room beckys face troubled him considering all things he
did not want to pity her and yet it was all he could do to help it he
could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name presently
the spelling book discovery was made and toms mind was entirely full
of his own matters for a while after that becky roused up from her
lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings she
did not expect that tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
spilt the ink on the book himself and she was right the denial only
seemed to make the thing worse for tom becky supposed she would be
glad of that and she tried to believe she was glad of it but she
found she was not certain when the worst came to the worst she had an
impulse to get up and tell on alfred temple but she made an effort and
forced herself to keep still because said she to herself hell tell
about me tearing the picture sure i wouldnt say a word not to save
his life 

tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
broken hearted for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
upset the ink on the spelling book himself in some skylarking bout he
had denied it for forms sake and because it was custom and had stuck
to the denial from principle 

a whole hour drifted by the master sat nodding in his throne the air
was drowsy with the hum of study by and by mr dobbins straightened
himself up yawned then unlocked his desk and reached for his book 
but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it most of the
pupils glanced up languidly but there were two among them that watched
his movements with intent eyes mr dobbins fingered his book absently
for a while then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read 
tom shot a glance at becky he had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit
look as she did with a gun levelled at its head instantly he forgot
his quarrel with her quick something must be done done in a flash 
too but the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention 
good he had an inspiration he would run and snatch the book spring
through the door and fly but his resolution shook for one little
instant and the chance was lost the master opened the volume if tom
only had the wasted opportunity back again too late there was no help
for becky now he said the next moment the master faced the school 
every eye sank under his gaze there was that in it which smote even
the innocent with fear there was silence while one might count ten
 the master was gathering his wrath then he spoke who tore this book 

there was not a sound one could have heard a pin drop the stillness
continued the master searched face after face for signs of guilt 

 benjamin rogers did you tear this book 

a denial another pause 

 joseph harper did you 

another denial toms uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
slow torture of these proceedings the master scanned the ranks of
boys considered a while then turned to the girls 

 amy lawrence 

a shake of the head 

 gracie miller 

the same sign 

 susan harper did you do this 

another negative the next girl was becky thatcher tom was trembling
from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of
the situation 

 rebecca thatcher tom glanced at her face it was white with terror 
 did you tear no look me in the face her hands rose in appeal 
 did you tear this book 

a thought shot like lightning through toms brain he sprang to his
feet and shouted i done it 

the school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly tom stood a
moment to gather his dismembered faculties and when he stepped
forward to go to his punishment the surprise the gratitude the
adoration that shone upon him out of poor beckys eyes seemed pay
enough for a hundred floggings inspired by the splendor of his own
act he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr 
dobbins had ever administered and also received with indifference the
added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be
dismissed for he knew who would wait for him outside till his
captivity was done and not count the tedious time as loss either 

tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against alfred temple 
for with shame and repentance becky had told him all not forgetting
her own treachery but even the longing for vengeance had to give way 
soon to pleasanter musings and he fell asleep at last with beckys
latest words lingering dreamily in his ear 

 tom how could you be so noble 



chapter xxi

vacation was approaching the schoolmaster always severe grew
severer and more exacting than ever for he wanted the school to make a
good showing on examination day his rod and his ferule were seldom
idle now at least among the smaller pupils only the biggest boys and
young ladies of eighteen and twenty escaped lashing mr dobbins
lashings were very vigorous ones too for although he carried under
his wig a perfectly bald and shiny head he had only reached middle
age and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle as the great
day approached all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface he
seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least
shortcomings the consequence was that the smaller boys spent their
days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge they
threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief but he kept
ahead all the time the retribution that followed every vengeful
success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from
the field badly worsted at last they conspired together and hit upon a
plan that promised a dazzling victory they swore in the sign painters
boy told him the scheme and asked his help he had his own reasons
for being delighted for the master boarded in his fathers family and
had given the boy ample cause to hate him the masters wife would go
on a visit to the country in a few days and there would be nothing to
interfere with the plan the master always prepared himself for great
occasions by getting pretty well fuddled and the sign painters boy
said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on
examination evening he would manage the thing while he napped in his
chair then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried
away to school 

in the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived at eight in
the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted and adorned with
wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers the master sat throned in
his great chair upon a raised platform with his blackboard behind him 
he was looking tolerably mellow three rows of benches on each side and
six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
and by the parents of the pupils to his left back of the rows of
citizens was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening rows of
small boys washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort 
rows of gawky big boys snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in
lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms their
grandmothers ancient trinkets their bits of pink and blue ribbon and
the flowers in their hair all the rest of the house was filled with
non participating scholars 

the exercises began a very little boy stood up and sheepishly
recited youd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the
stage etc accompanying himself with the painfully exact and
spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used supposing the
machine to be a trifle out of order but he got through safely though
cruelly scared and got a fine round of applause when he made his
manufactured bow and retired 

a little shamefaced girl lisped mary had a little lamb etc 
performed a compassion inspiring curtsy got her meed of applause and
sat down flushed and happy 

tom sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into
the unquenchable and indestructible give me liberty or give me death 
speech with fine fury and frantic gesticulation and broke down in the
middle of it a ghastly stage fright seized him his legs quaked under
him and he was like to choke true he had the manifest sympathy of the
house but he had the houses silence too which was even worse than
its sympathy the master frowned and this completed the disaster tom
struggled awhile and then retired utterly defeated there was a weak
attempt at applause but it died early 

 the boy stood on the burning deck followed also the assyrian came
down and other declamatory gems then there were reading exercises 
and a spelling fight the meagre latin class recited with honor the
prime feature of the evening was in order now original compositions 
by the young ladies each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of
the platform cleared her throat held up her manuscript tied with
dainty ribbon and proceeded to read with labored attention to
 expression and punctuation the themes were the same that had been
illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them their
grandmothers and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line
clear back to the crusades friendship was one memories of other
days religion in history dream land the advantages of
culture forms of political government compared and contrasted 
 melancholy filial love heart longings etc etc 

a prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
melancholy another was a wasteful and opulent gush of fine language 
another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words
and phrases until they were worn entirely out and a peculiarity that
conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable
sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one
of them no matter what the subject might be a brain racking effort
was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and
religious mind could contemplate with edification the glaring
insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the
banishment of the fashion from the schools and it is not sufficient
to day it never will be sufficient while the world stands perhaps 
there is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel
obliged to close their compositions with a sermon and you will find
that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in
the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious but
enough of this homely truth is unpalatable 

let us return to the examination the first composition that was
read was one entitled is this then life perhaps the reader can
endure an extract from it 

 in the common walks of life with what delightful
 emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some
 anticipated scene of festivity imagination is busy
 sketching rose tinted pictures of joy in fancy the
 voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the
 festive throng the observed of all observers her
 graceful form arrayed in snowy robes is whirling
 through the mazes of the joyous dance her eye is
 brightest her step is lightest in the gay assembly 

 in such delicious fancies time quickly glides by 
 and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into
 the elysian world of which she has had such bright
 dreams how fairy like does everything appear to
 her enchanted vision each new scene is more charming
 than the last but after a while she finds that
 beneath this goodly exterior all is vanity the
 flattery which once charmed her soul now grates
 harshly upon her ear the ball room has lost its
 charms and with wasted health and imbittered heart 
 she turns away with the conviction that earthly
 pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul 

and so forth and so on there was a buzz of gratification from time to
time during the reading accompanied by whispered ejaculations of how
sweet how eloquent so true etc and after the thing had closed
with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic 

then arose a slim melancholy girl whose face had the interesting 
paleness that comes of pills and indigestion and read a poem two
stanzas of it will do 

 a missouri maidens farewell to alabama

 alabama good bye i love thee well 
 but yet for a while do i leave thee now 
 sad yes sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell 
 and burning recollections throng my brow 
 for i have wandered through thy flowery woods 
 have roamed and read near tallapoosas stream 
 have listened to tallassees warring floods 
 and wooed on coosas side auroras beam 

 yet shame i not to bear an oer full heart 
 nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes 
 tis from no stranger land i now must part 
 tis to no strangers left i yield these sighs 
 welcome and home were mine within this state 
 whose vales i leave whose spires fade fast from me
 and cold must be mine eyes and heart and tete 
 when dear alabama they turn cold on thee 

there were very few there who knew what tete meant but the poem was
very satisfactory nevertheless 

next appeared a dark complexioned black eyed black haired young
lady who paused an impressive moment assumed a tragic expression and
began to read in a measured solemn tone 

 a vision

 dark and tempestuous was night around the
 throne on high not a single star quivered but
 the deep intonations of the heavy thunder
 constantly vibrated upon the ear whilst the
 terrific lightning revelled in angry mood
 through the cloudy chambers of heaven seeming
 to scorn the power exerted over its terror by
 the illustrious franklin even the boisterous
 winds unanimously came forth from their mystic
 homes and blustered about as if to enhance by
 their aid the wildness of the scene 

 at such a time so dark so dreary for human
 sympathy my very spirit sighed but instead thereof 

 my dearest friend my counsellor my comforter
 and guide my joy in grief my second bliss
 in joy came to my side she moved like one of
 those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks
 of fancys eden by the romantic and young a
 queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
 transcendent loveliness so soft was her step it
 failed to make even a sound and but for the
 magical thrill imparted by her genial touch as
 other unobtrusive beauties she would have glided
 away un perceived unsought a strange sadness
 rested upon her features like icy tears upon
 the robe of december as she pointed to the
 contending elements without and bade me contemplate
 the two beings presented 

this nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with
a sermon so destructive of all hope to non presbyterians that it took
the first prize this composition was considered to be the very finest
effort of the evening the mayor of the village in delivering the
prize to the author of it made a warm speech in which he said that it
was by far the most eloquent thing he had ever listened to and that
daniel webster himself might well be proud of it 

it may be remarked in passing that the number of compositions in
which the word beauteous was over fondled and human experience
referred to as lifes page was up to the usual average 

now the master mellow almost to the verge of geniality put his chair
aside turned his back to the audience and began to draw a map of
america on the blackboard to exercise the geography class upon but he
made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand and a smothered
titter rippled over the house he knew what the matter was and set
himself to right it he sponged out lines and remade them but he only
distorted them more than ever and the tittering was more pronounced 
he threw his entire attention upon his work now as if determined not
to be put down by the mirth he felt that all eyes were fastened upon
him he imagined he was succeeding and yet the tittering continued it
even manifestly increased and well it might there was a garret above 
pierced with a scuttle over his head and down through this scuttle
came a cat suspended around the haunches by a string she had a rag
tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing as she slowly
descended she curved upward and clawed at the string she swung
downward and clawed at the intangible air the tittering rose higher
and higher the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teachers
head down down a little lower and she grabbed his wig with her
desperate claws clung to it and was snatched up into the garret in an
instant with her trophy still in her possession and how the light did
blaze abroad from the masters bald pate for the sign painters boy
had gilded it 

that broke up the meeting the boys were avenged vacation had come 

 note the pretended compositions quoted in
 this chapter are taken without alteration from a
 volume entitled prose and poetry by a western
 lady but they are exactly and precisely after
 the schoolgirl pattern and hence are much
 happier than any mere imitations could be 



chapter xxii

tom joined the new order of cadets of temperance being attracted by
the showy character of their regalia he promised to abstain from
smoking chewing and profanity as long as he remained a member now he
found out a new thing namely that to promise not to do a thing is the
surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very
thing tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and
swear the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a
chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing
from the order fourth of july was coming but he soon gave that up
 gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty eight hours and
fixed his hopes upon old judge frazer justice of the peace who was
apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral since
he was so high an official during three days tom was deeply concerned
about the judges condition and hungry for news of it sometimes his
hopes ran high so high that he would venture to get out his regalia
and practise before the looking glass but the judge had a most
discouraging way of fluctuating at last he was pronounced upon the
mend and then convalescent tom was disgusted and felt a sense of
injury too he handed in his resignation at once and that night the
judge suffered a relapse and died tom resolved that he would never
trust a man like that again 

the funeral was a fine thing the cadets paraded in a style calculated
to kill the late member with envy tom was a free boy again however
 there was something in that he could drink and swear now but found
to his surprise that he did not want to the simple fact that he could 
took the desire away and the charm of it 

tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
to hang a little heavily on his hands 

he attempted a diary but nothing happened during three days and so
he abandoned it 

the first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town and made a
sensation tom and joe harper got up a band of performers and were
happy for two days 

even the glorious fourth was in some sense a failure for it rained
hard there was no procession in consequence and the greatest man in
the world as tom supposed mr benton an actual united states
senator proved an overwhelming disappointment for he was not
twenty five feet high nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it 

a circus came the boys played circus for three days afterward in
tents made of rag carpeting admission three pins for boys two for
girls and then circusing was abandoned 

a phrenologist and a mesmerizer came and went again and left the
village duller and drearier than ever 

there were some boys and girls parties but they were so few and so
delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder 

becky thatcher was gone to her constantinople home to stay with her
parents during vacation so there was no bright side to life anywhere 

the dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery it was a very
cancer for permanency and pain 

then came the measles 

during two long weeks tom lay a prisoner dead to the world and its
happenings he was very ill he was interested in nothing when he got
upon his feet at last and moved feebly down town a melancholy change
had come over everything and every creature there had been a
 revival and everybody had got religion not only the adults but
even the boys and girls tom went about hoping against hope for the
sight of one blessed sinful face but disappointment crossed him
everywhere he found joe harper studying a testament and turned sadly
away from the depressing spectacle he sought ben rogers and found him
visiting the poor with a basket of tracts he hunted up jim hollis who
called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a
warning every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression 
and when in desperation he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of
huckleberry finn and was received with a scriptural quotation his
heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all
the town was lost forever and forever 

and that night there came on a terrific storm with driving rain 
awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning he covered his
head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his
doom for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was
about him he believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above
to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result it might
have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
battery of artillery but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf
from under an insect like himself 

by and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
object the boys first impulse was to be grateful and reform his
second was to wait for there might not be any more storms 

the next day the doctors were back tom had relapsed the three weeks
he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age when he got abroad
at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared remembering how
lonely was his estate how companionless and forlorn he was he drifted
listlessly down the street and found jim hollis acting as judge in a
juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder in the presence of her
victim a bird he found joe harper and huck finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon poor lads they like tom had suffered a relapse 



chapter xxiii

at last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred and vigorously the murder
trial came on in the court it became the absorbing topic of village
talk immediately tom could not get away from it every reference to
the murder sent a shudder to his heart for his troubled conscience and
fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his
hearing as feelers he did not see how he could be suspected of
knowing anything about the murder but still he could not be
comfortable in the midst of this gossip it kept him in a cold shiver
all the time he took huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him 
it would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while to
divide his burden of distress with another sufferer moreover he
wanted to assure himself that huck had remained discreet 

 huck have you ever told anybody about that 

 bout what 

 you know what 

 oh course i havent 

 never a word 

 never a solitary word so help me what makes you ask 

 well i was afeard 

 why tom sawyer we wouldnt be alive two days if that got found out 
you know that 

tom felt more comfortable after a pause 

 huck they couldnt anybody get you to tell could they 

 get me to tell why if i wanted that half breed devil to drownd me
they could get me to tell they aint no different way 

 well thats all right then i reckon were safe as long as we keep
mum but lets swear again anyway its more surer 

 im agreed 

so they swore again with dread solemnities 

 what is the talk around huck ive heard a power of it 

 talk well its just muff potter muff potter muff potter all the
time it keeps me in a sweat constant sos i want to hide somers 

 thats just the same way they go on round me i reckon hes a goner 
dont you feel sorry for him sometimes 

 most always most always he aint no account but then he haint
ever done anything to hurt anybody just fishes a little to get money
to get drunk on and loafs around considerable but lord we all do
that leastways most of us preachers and such like but hes kind of
good he give me half a fish once when there warnt enough for two 
and lots of times hes kind of stood by me when i was out of luck 

 well hes mended kites for me huck and knitted hooks on to my
line i wish we could get him out of there 

 my we couldnt get him out tom and besides twouldnt do any
good theyd ketch him again 

 yes so they would but i hate to hear em abuse him so like the
dickens when he never done that 

 i do too tom lord i hear em say hes the bloodiest looking
villain in this country and they wonder he wasnt ever hung before 

 yes they talk like that all the time ive heard em say that if he
was to get free theyd lynch him 

 and theyd do it too 

the boys had a long talk but it brought them little comfort as the
twilight drew on they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
of the little isolated jail perhaps with an undefined hope that
something would happen that might clear away their difficulties but
nothing happened there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
this luckless captive 

the boys did as they had often done before went to the cell grating
and gave potter some tobacco and matches he was on the ground floor
and there were no guards 

his gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
before it cut deeper than ever this time they felt cowardly and
treacherous to the last degree when potter said 

 youve been mighty good to me boys bettern anybody else in this
town and i dont forget it i dont often i says to myself says i 
i used to mend all the boys kites and things and show em where the
good fishin places was and befriend em what i could and now theyve
all forgot old muff when hes in trouble but tom dont and huck
dont they dont forget him says i and i dont forget them well 
boys i done an awful thing drunk and crazy at the time thats the
only way i account for it and now i got to swing for it and its
right right and best too i reckon hope so anyway well we wont
talk about that i dont want to make you feel bad youve befriended
me but what i want to say is dont you ever get drunk then you wont
ever get here stand a litter furder west so thats it its a prime
comfort to see faces thats friendly when a bodys in such a muck of
trouble and there dont none come here but yourn good friendly
faces good friendly faces git up on one anothers backs and let me
touch em thats it shake hands yournll come through the bars but
mines too big little hands and weak but theyve helped muff potter
a power and theyd help him more if they could 

tom went home miserable and his dreams that night were full of
horrors the next day and the day after he hung about the court room 
drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in but forcing himself
to stay out huck was having the same experience they studiously
avoided each other each wandered away from time to time but the same
dismal fascination always brought them back presently tom kept his
ears open when idlers sauntered out of the court room but invariably
heard distressing news the toils were closing more and more
relentlessly around poor potter at the end of the second day the
village talk was to the effect that injun joes evidence stood firm and
unshaken and that there was not the slightest question as to what the
jurys verdict would be 

tom was out late that night and came to bed through the window he
was in a tremendous state of excitement it was hours before he got to
sleep all the village flocked to the court house the next morning for
this was to be the great day both sexes were about equally represented
in the packed audience after a long wait the jury filed in and took
their places shortly afterward potter pale and haggard timid and
hopeless was brought in with chains upon him and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him no less conspicuous was injun joe 
stolid as ever there was another pause and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court the usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed these
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating 

now a witness was called who testified that he found muff potter
washing in the brook at an early hour of the morning that the murder
was discovered and that he immediately sneaked away after some
further questioning counsel for the prosecution said 

 take the witness 

the prisoner raised his eyes for a moment but dropped them again when
his own counsel said 

 i have no questions to ask him 

the next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse 
counsel for the prosecution said 

 take the witness 

 i have no questions to ask him potters lawyer replied 

a third witness swore he had often seen the knife in potters
possession 

 take the witness 

counsel for potter declined to question him the faces of the audience
began to betray annoyance did this attorney mean to throw away his
clients life without an effort 

several witnesses deposed concerning potters guilty behavior when
brought to the scene of the murder they were allowed to leave the
stand without being cross questioned 

every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
brought out by credible witnesses but none of them were cross examined
by potters lawyer the perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench 
counsel for the prosecution now said 

 by the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion we
have fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility of question 
upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar we rest our case here 

a groan escaped from poor potter and he put his face in his hands and
rocked his body softly to and fro while a painful silence reigned in
the court room many men were moved and many womens compassion
testified itself in tears counsel for the defence rose and said 

 your honor in our remarks at the opening of this trial we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium
produced by drink we have changed our mind we shall not offer that
plea then to the clerk call thomas sawyer 

a puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house not even
excepting potters every eye fastened itself with wondering interest
upon tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand the boy looked
wild enough for he was badly scared the oath was administered 

 thomas sawyer where were you on the seventeenth of june about the
hour of midnight 

tom glanced at injun joes iron face and his tongue failed him the
audience listened breathless but the words refused to come after a
few moments however the boy got a little of his strength back and
managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house
hear 

 in the graveyard 

 a little bit louder please dont be afraid you were 

 in the graveyard 

a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joes face 

 were you anywhere near horse williams grave 

 yes sir 

 speak up just a trifle louder how near were you 

 near as i am to you 

 were you hidden or not 

 i was hid 

 where 

 behind the elms thats on the edge of the grave 

injun joe gave a barely perceptible start 

 any one with you 

 yes sir i went there with 

 wait wait a moment never mind mentioning your companions name we
will produce him at the proper time did you carry anything there with
you 

tom hesitated and looked confused 

 speak out my boy dont be diffident the truth is always
respectable what did you take there 

 only a a dead cat 

there was a ripple of mirth which the court checked 

 we will produce the skeleton of that cat now my boy tell us
everything that occurred tell it in your own way dont skip anything 
and dont be afraid 

tom began hesitatingly at first but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily in a little while every sound ceased
but his own voice every eye fixed itself upon him with parted lips
and bated breath the audience hung upon his words taking no note of
time rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale the strain upon
pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said 

 and as the doctor fetched the board around and muff potter fell 
injun joe jumped with the knife and 

crash quick as lightning the half breed sprang for a window tore his
way through all opposers and was gone 



chapter xxiv

tom was a glittering hero once more the pet of the old the envy of
the young his name even went into immortal print for the village
paper magnified him there were some that believed he would be
president yet if he escaped hanging 

as usual the fickle unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before but that sort
of conduct is to the worlds credit therefore it is not well to find
fault with it 

toms days were days of splendor and exultation to him but his nights
were seasons of horror injun joe infested all his dreams and always
with doom in his eye hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to
stir abroad after nightfall poor huck was in the same state of
wretchedness and terror for tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
the night before the great day of the trial and huck was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out yet notwithstanding
injun joes flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court 
the poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy but what of
that since toms harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyers house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been
sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths hucks
confidence in the human race was well nigh obliterated 

daily muff potters gratitude made tom glad he had spoken but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue 

half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured the
other half he was afraid he would be he felt sure he never could draw
a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse 

rewards had been offered the country had been scoured but no injun
joe was found one of those omniscient and awe inspiring marvels a
detective came up from st louis moused around shook his head 
looked wise and made that sort of astounding success which members of
that craft usually achieve that is to say he found a clew but you
cant hang a clew for murder and so after that detective had got
through and gone home tom felt just as insecure as he was before 

the slow days drifted on and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension 



chapter xxv

there comes a time in every rightly constructed boys life when he has
a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure this
desire suddenly came upon tom one day he sallied out to find joe
harper but failed of success next he sought ben rogers he had gone
fishing presently he stumbled upon huck finn the red handed huck
would answer tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to
him confidentially huck was willing huck was always willing to take a
hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no
capital for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time
which is not money wherell we dig said huck 

 oh most anywhere 

 why is it hid all around 

 no indeed it aint its hid in mighty particular places huck
 sometimes on islands sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a
limb of an old dead tree just where the shadow falls at midnight but
mostly under the floor in hanted houses 

 who hides it 

 why robbers of course whod you reckon sunday school
suprintendents 

 i dont know if twas mine i wouldnt hide it id spend it and have
a good time 

 so would i but robbers dont do that way they always hide it and
leave it there 

 dont they come after it any more 

 no they think they will but they generally forget the marks or
else they die anyway it lays there a long time and gets rusty and by
and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the
marks a paper thats got to be ciphered over about a week because its
mostly signs and hyroglyphics 

 hyro which 

 hyroglyphics pictures and things you know that dont seem to mean
anything 

 have you got one of them papers tom 

 no 

 well then how you going to find the marks 

 i dont want any marks they always bury it under a hanted house or
on an island or under a dead tree thats got one limb sticking out 
well weve tried jacksons island a little and we can try it again
some time and theres the old hanted house up the still house branch 
and theres lots of dead limb trees dead loads of em 

 is it under all of them 

 how you talk no 

 then how you going to know which one to go for 

 go for all of em 

 why tom itll take all summer 

 well what of that suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred
dollars in it all rusty and gray or rotten chest full of dimonds 
hows that 

hucks eyes glowed 

 thats bully plenty bully enough for me just you gimme the hundred
dollars and i dont want no dimonds 

 all right but i bet you i aint going to throw off on dimonds some
of ems worth twenty dollars apiece there aint any hardly buts
worth six bits or a dollar 

 no is that so 

 certnly anybodyll tell you so haint you ever seen one huck 

 not as i remember 

 oh kings have slathers of them 

 well i don know no kings tom 

 i reckon you dont but if you was to go to europe youd see a raft
of em hopping around 

 do they hop 

 hop your granny no 

 well what did you say they did for 

 shucks i only meant youd see em not hopping of course what do
they want to hop for but i mean youd just see em scattered around 
you know in a kind of a general way like that old humpbacked richard 

 richard whats his other name 

 he didnt have any other name kings dont have any but a given name 

 no 

 but they dont 

 well if they like it tom all right but i dont want to be a king
and have only just a given name like a nigger but say where you
going to dig first 

 well i dont know spose we tackle that old dead limb tree on the
hill tother side of still house branch 

 im agreed 

so they got a crippled pick and a shovel and set out on their
three mile tramp they arrived hot and panting and threw themselves
down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke 

 i like this said tom 

 so do i 

 say huck if we find a treasure here what you going to do with your
share 

 well ill have pie and a glass of soda every day and ill go to
every circus that comes along i bet ill have a gay time 

 well aint you going to save any of it 

 save it what for 

 why so as to have something to live on by and by 

 oh that aint any use pap would come back to thish yer town some
day and get his claws on it if i didnt hurry up and i tell you hed
clean it out pretty quick what you going to do with yourn tom 

 im going to buy a new drum and a sure nough sword and a red
necktie and a bull pup and get married 

 married 

 thats it 

 tom you why you aint in your right mind 

 wait youll see 

 well thats the foolishest thing you could do look at pap and my
mother fight why they used to fight all the time i remember mighty
well 

 that aint anything the girl im going to marry wont fight 

 tom i reckon theyre all alike theyll all comb a body now you
better think bout this awhile i tell you you better whats the name
of the gal 

 it aint a gal at all its a girl 

 its all the same i reckon some says gal some says girl boths
right like enough anyway whats her name tom 

 ill tell you some time not now 

 all right thatll do only if you get married ill be more lonesomer
than ever 

 no you wont youll come and live with me now stir out of this and
well go to digging 

they worked and sweated for half an hour no result they toiled
another half hour still no result huck said 

 do they always bury it as deep as this 

 sometimes not always not generally i reckon we havent got the
right place 

so they chose a new spot and began again the labor dragged a little 
but still they made progress they pegged away in silence for some
time finally huck leaned on his shovel swabbed the beaded drops from
his brow with his sleeve and said 

 where you going to dig next after we get this one 

 i reckon maybe well tackle the old tree thats over yonder on
cardiff hill back of the widows 

 i reckon thatll be a good one but wont the widow take it away from
us tom its on her land 

 she take it away maybe shed like to try it once whoever finds one
of these hid treasures it belongs to him it dont make any difference
whose land its on 

that was satisfactory the work went on by and by huck said 

 blame it we must be in the wrong place again what do you think 

 it is mighty curious huck i dont understand it sometimes witches
interfere i reckon maybe thats whats the trouble now 

 shucks witches aint got no power in the daytime 

 well thats so i didnt think of that oh i know what the matter
is what a blamed lot of fools we are you got to find out where the
shadow of the limb falls at midnight and thats where you dig 

 then consound it weve fooled away all this work for nothing now
hang it all we got to come back in the night its an awful long way 
can you get out 

 i bet i will weve got to do it to night too because if somebody
sees these holes theyll know in a minute whats here and theyll go
for it 

 well ill come around and maow to night 

 all right lets hide the tools in the bushes 

the boys were there that night about the appointed time they sat in
the shadow waiting it was a lonely place and an hour made solemn by
old traditions spirits whispered in the rustling leaves ghosts lurked
in the murky nooks the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
distance an owl answered with his sepulchral note the boys were
subdued by these solemnities and talked little by and by they judged
that twelve had come they marked where the shadow fell and began to
dig their hopes commenced to rise their interest grew stronger and
their industry kept pace with it the hole deepened and still deepened 
but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
something they only suffered a new disappointment it was only a stone
or a chunk at last tom said 

 it aint any use huck were wrong again 

 well but we cant be wrong we spotted the shadder to a dot 

 i know it but then theres another thing 

 whats that 

 why we only guessed at the time like enough it was too late or too
early 

huck dropped his shovel 

 thats it said he thats the very trouble we got to give this
one up we cant ever tell the right time and besides this kind of
things too awful here this time of night with witches and ghosts
a fluttering around so i feel as if somethings behind me all the time 
and im afeard to turn around becuz maybe theres others in front
a waiting for a chance i been creeping all over ever since i got here 

 well ive been pretty much so too huck they most always put in a
dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree to look out for it 

 lordy 

 yes they do ive always heard that 

 tom i dont like to fool around much where theres dead people a
bodys bound to get into trouble with em sure 

 i dont like to stir em up either spose this one here was to
stick his skull out and say something 

 dont tom its awful 

 well it just is huck i dont feel comfortable a bit 

 say tom lets give this place up and try somewheres else 

 all right i reckon we better 

 whatll it be 

tom considered awhile and then said 

 the hanted house thats it 

 blame it i dont like hanted houses tom why theyre a dern sight
worsen dead people dead people might talk maybe but they dont come
sliding around in a shroud when you aint noticing and peep over your
shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth the way a ghost does i
couldnt stand such a thing as that tom nobody could 

 yes but huck ghosts dont travel around only at night they wont
hender us from digging there in the daytime 

 well thats so but you know mighty well people dont go about that
hanted house in the day nor the night 

 well thats mostly because they dont like to go where a mans been
murdered anyway but nothings ever been seen around that house except
in the night just some blue lights slipping by the windows no regular
ghosts 

 well where you see one of them blue lights flickering around tom 
you can bet theres a ghost mighty close behind it it stands to
reason becuz you know that they dont anybody but ghosts use em 

 yes thats so but anyway they dont come around in the daytime so
whats the use of our being afeard 

 well all right well tackle the hanted house if you say so but i
reckon its taking chances 

they had started down the hill by this time there in the middle of
the moonlit valley below them stood the hanted house utterly
isolated its fences gone long ago rank weeds smothering the very
doorsteps the chimney crumbled to ruin the window sashes vacant a
corner of the roof caved in the boys gazed awhile half expecting to
see a blue light flit past a window then talking in a low tone as
befitted the time and the circumstances they struck far off to the
right to give the haunted house a wide berth and took their way
homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of cardiff
hill 



chapter xxvi

about noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree they had
come for their tools tom was impatient to go to the haunted house 
huck was measurably so also but suddenly said 

 lookyhere tom do you know what day it is 

tom mentally ran over the days of the week and then quickly lifted
his eyes with a startled look in them 

 my i never once thought of it huck 

 well i didnt neither but all at once it popped onto me that it was
friday 

 blame it a body cant be too careful huck we might a got into an
awful scrape tackling such a thing on a friday 

 might better say we would theres some lucky days maybe but
friday aint 

 any fool knows that i dont reckon you was the first that found it
out huck 

 well i never said i was did i and friday aint all neither i had
a rotten bad dream last night dreampt about rats 

 no sure sign of trouble did they fight 

 no 

 well thats good huck when they dont fight its only a sign that
theres trouble around you know all we got to do is to look mighty
sharp and keep out of it well drop this thing for to day and play 
do you know robin hood huck 

 no whos robin hood 

 why he was one of the greatest men that was ever in england and the
best he was a robber 

 cracky i wisht i was who did he rob 

 only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings and such like 
but he never bothered the poor he loved em he always divided up with
em perfectly square 

 well he must a been a brick 

 i bet you he was huck oh he was the noblest man that ever was 
they aint any such men now i can tell you he could lick any man in
england with one hand tied behind him and he could take his yew bow
and plug a ten cent piece every time a mile and a half 

 whats a yew bow 

 i dont know its some kind of a bow of course and if he hit that
dime only on the edge he would set down and cry and curse but well
play robin hood its nobby fun ill learn you 

 im agreed 

so they played robin hood all the afternoon now and then casting a
yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
morrows prospects and possibilities there as the sun began to sink
into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of
the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of cardiff
hill 

on saturday shortly after noon the boys were at the dead tree again 
they had a smoke and a chat in the shade and then dug a little in
their last hole not with great hope but merely because tom said there
were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting
down within six inches of it and then somebody else had come along and
turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel the thing failed this
time however so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
that they had not trifled with fortune but had fulfilled all the
requirements that belong to the business of treasure hunting 

when they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun 
and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
place that they were afraid for a moment to venture in then they
crept to the door and took a trembling peep they saw a weed grown 
floorless room unplastered an ancient fireplace vacant windows a
ruinous staircase and here there and everywhere hung ragged and
abandoned cobwebs they presently entered softly with quickened
pulses talking in whispers ears alert to catch the slightest sound 
and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat 

in a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
place a critical and interested examination rather admiring their own
boldness and wondering at it too next they wanted to look up stairs 
this was something like cutting off retreat but they got to daring
each other and of course there could be but one result they threw
their tools into a corner and made the ascent up there were the same
signs of decay in one corner they found a closet that promised
mystery but the promise was a fraud there was nothing in it their
courage was up now and well in hand they were about to go down and
begin work when 

 sh said tom 

 what is it whispered huck blanching with fright 

 sh there hear it 

 yes oh my lets run 

 keep still dont you budge theyre coming right toward the door 

the boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
knot holes in the planking and lay waiting in a misery of fear 

 theyve stopped no coming here they are dont whisper
another word huck my goodness i wish i was out of this 

two men entered each boy said to himself theres the old deaf and
dumb spaniard thats been about town once or twice lately never saw
tother man before 

 tother was a ragged unkempt creature with nothing very pleasant
in his face the spaniard was wrapped in a serape he had bushy white
whiskers long white hair flowed from under his sombrero and he wore
green goggles when they came in tother was talking in a low voice 
they sat down on the ground facing the door with their backs to the
wall and the speaker continued his remarks his manner became less
guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded 

 no said he ive thought it all over and i dont like it its
dangerous 

 dangerous grunted the deaf and dumb spaniard to the vast
surprise of the boys milksop 

this voice made the boys gasp and quake it was injun joes there was
silence for some time then joe said 

 whats any more dangerous than that job up yonder but nothings come
of it 

 thats different away up the river so and not another house about 
twont ever be known that we tried anyway long as we didnt succeed 

 well whats more dangerous than coming here in the daytime anybody
would suspicion us that saw us 

 i know that but there warnt any other place as handy after that
fool of a job i want to quit this shanty i wanted to yesterday only
it warnt any use trying to stir out of here with those infernal boys
playing over there on the hill right in full view 

 those infernal boys quaked again under the inspiration of this
remark and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was
friday and concluded to wait a day they wished in their hearts they
had waited a year 

the two men got out some food and made a luncheon after a long and
thoughtful silence injun joe said 

 look here lad you go back up the river where you belong wait there
till you hear from me ill take the chances on dropping into this town
just once more for a look well do that dangerous job after ive
spied around a little and think things look well for it then for
texas well leg it together 

this was satisfactory both men presently fell to yawning and injun
joe said 

 im dead for sleep its your turn to watch 

he curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore his comrade
stirred him once or twice and he became quiet presently the watcher
began to nod his head drooped lower and lower both men began to snore
now 

the boys drew a long grateful breath tom whispered 

 nows our chance come 

huck said 

 i cant id die if they was to wake 

tom urged huck held back at last tom rose slowly and softly and
started alone but the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright he
never made a second attempt the boys lay there counting the dragging
moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity
growing gray and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun
was setting 

now one snore ceased injun joe sat up stared around smiled grimly
upon his comrade whose head was drooping upon his knees stirred him
up with his foot and said 

 here youre a watchman aint you all right though nothings
happened 

 my have i been asleep 

 oh partly partly nearly time for us to be moving pard whatll we
do with what little swag weve got left 

 i dont know leave it here as weve always done i reckon no use to
take it away till we start south six hundred and fifty in silvers
something to carry 

 well all right it wont matter to come here once more 

 no but id say come in the night as we used to do its better 

 yes but look here it may be a good while before i get the right
chance at that job accidents might happen taint in such a very good
place well just regularly bury it and bury it deep 

 good idea said the comrade who walked across the room knelt down 
raised one of the rearward hearth stones and took out a bag that
jingled pleasantly he subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for
himself and as much for injun joe and passed the bag to the latter 
who was on his knees in the corner now digging with his bowie knife 

the boys forgot all their fears all their miseries in an instant 
with gloating eyes they watched every movement luck the splendor of
it was beyond all imagination six hundred dollars was money enough to
make half a dozen boys rich here was treasure hunting under the
happiest auspices there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to
where to dig they nudged each other every moment eloquent nudges and
easily understood for they simply meant oh but aint you glad now
were here 

joes knife struck upon something 

 hello said he 

 what is it said his comrade 

 half rotten plank no its a box i believe here bear a hand and
well see what its here for never mind ive broke a hole 

he reached his hand in and drew it out 

 man its money 

the two men examined the handful of coins they were gold the boys
above were as excited as themselves and as delighted 

joes comrade said 

 well make quick work of this theres an old rusty pick over amongst
the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace i saw it a
minute ago 

he ran and brought the boys pick and shovel injun joe took the pick 
looked it over critically shook his head muttered something to
himself and then began to use it the box was soon unearthed it was
not very large it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
slow years had injured it the men contemplated the treasure awhile in
blissful silence 

 pard theres thousands of dollars here said injun joe 

 twas always said that murrels gang used to be around here one
summer the stranger observed 

 i know it said injun joe and this looks like it i should say 

 now you wont need to do that job 

the half breed frowned said he 

 you dont know me least you dont know all about that thing taint
robbery altogether its revenge and a wicked light flamed in his
eyes ill need your help in it when its finished then texas go
home to your nance and your kids and stand by till you hear from me 

 well if you say so whatll we do with this bury it again 

 yes ravishing delight overhead no by the great sachem no 
 profound distress overhead id nearly forgot that pick had fresh
earth on it the boys were sick with terror in a moment what
business has a pick and a shovel here what business with fresh earth
on them who brought them here and where are they gone have you heard
anybody seen anybody what bury it again and leave them to come and
see the ground disturbed not exactly not exactly well take it to my
den 

 why of course might have thought of that before you mean number
one 

 no number two under the cross the other place is bad too common 

 all right its nearly dark enough to start 

injun joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously
peeping out presently he said 

 who could have brought those tools here do you reckon they can be
up stairs 

the boys breath forsook them injun joe put his hand on his knife 
halted a moment undecided and then turned toward the stairway the
boys thought of the closet but their strength was gone the steps came
creaking up the stairs the intolerable distress of the situation woke
the stricken resolution of the lads they were about to spring for the
closet when there was a crash of rotten timbers and injun joe landed
on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway he gathered
himself up cursing and his comrade said 

 now whats the use of all that if its anybody and theyre up
there let them stay there who cares if they want to jump down now 
and get into trouble who objects it will be dark in fifteen minutes
 and then let them follow us if they want to im willing in my
opinion whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and
took us for ghosts or devils or something ill bet theyre running
yet 

joe grumbled awhile then he agreed with his friend that what daylight
was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving 
shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening
twilight and moved toward the river with their precious box 

tom and huck rose up weak but vastly relieved and stared after them
through the chinks between the logs of the house follow not they 
they were content to reach ground again without broken necks and take
the townward track over the hill they did not talk much they were too
much absorbed in hating themselves hating the ill luck that made them
take the spade and the pick there but for that injun joe never would
have suspected he would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait
there till his revenge was satisfied and then he would have had the
misfortune to find that money turn up missing bitter bitter luck that
the tools were ever brought there 

they resolved to keep a lookout for that spaniard when he should come
to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job and follow him
to number two wherever that might be then a ghastly thought
occurred to tom 

 revenge what if he means us huck 

 oh dont said huck nearly fainting 

they talked it all over and as they entered town they agreed to
believe that he might possibly mean somebody else at least that he
might at least mean nobody but tom since only tom had testified 

very very small comfort it was to tom to be alone in danger company
would be a palpable improvement he thought 



chapter xxvii

the adventure of the day mightily tormented toms dreams that night 
four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it
wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune as he lay
in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure he
noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away somewhat as if
they had happened in another world or in a time long gone by then it
occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream there
was one very strong argument in favor of this idea namely that the
quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real he had never seen
as much as fifty dollars in one mass before and he was like all boys
of his age and station in life in that he imagined that all references
to hundreds and thousands were mere fanciful forms of speech and
that no such sums really existed in the world he never had supposed
for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found
in actual money in any ones possession if his notions of hidden
treasure had been analyzed they would have been found to consist of a
handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague splendid ungraspable
dollars 

but the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
under the attrition of thinking them over and so he presently found
himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a
dream after all this uncertainty must be swept away he would snatch
a hurried breakfast and go and find huck huck was sitting on the
gunwale of a flatboat listlessly dangling his feet in the water and
looking very melancholy tom concluded to let huck lead up to the
subject if he did not do it then the adventure would be proved to
have been only a dream 

 hello huck 

 hello yourself 

silence for a minute 

 tom if wed a left the blame tools at the dead tree wed a got
the money oh aint it awful 

 taint a dream then taint a dream somehow i most wish it was 
dogd if i dont huck 

 what aint a dream 

 oh that thing yesterday i been half thinking it was 

 dream if them stairs hadnt broke down youd a seen how much dream
it was ive had dreams enough all night with that patch eyed spanish
devil going for me all through em rot him 

 no not rot him find him track the money 

 tom well never find him a feller dont have only one chance for
such a pile and that ones lost id feel mighty shaky if i was to see
him anyway 

 well sod i but id like to see him anyway and track him out to
his number two 

 number two yes thats it i been thinking bout that but i cant
make nothing out of it what do you reckon it is 

 i dono its too deep say huck maybe its the number of a house 

 goody no tom that aint it if it is it aint in this
one horse town they aint no numbers here 

 well thats so lemme think a minute here its the number of a
room in a tavern you know 

 oh thats the trick they aint only two taverns we can find out
quick 

 you stay here huck till i come 

tom was off at once he did not care to have hucks company in public
places he was gone half an hour he found that in the best tavern no 
 had long been occupied by a young lawyer and was still so occupied 
in the less ostentatious house no was a mystery the
tavern keepers young son said it was kept locked all the time and he
never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night he did
not know any particular reason for this state of things had had some
little curiosity but it was rather feeble had made the most of the
mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was
 hanted had noticed that there was a light in there the night before 

 thats what ive found out huck i reckon thats the very no 
were after 

 i reckon it is tom now what you going to do 

 lemme think 

tom thought a long time then he said 

 ill tell you the back door of that no is the door that comes out
into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap
of a brick store now you get hold of all the door keys you can find 
and ill nip all of aunties and the first dark night well go there
and try em and mind you keep a lookout for injun joe because he
said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a
chance to get his revenge if you see him you just follow him and if
he dont go to that no that aint the place 

 lordy i dont want to foller him by myself 

 why itll be night sure he mightnt ever see you and if he did 
maybe hed never think anything 

 well if its pretty dark i reckon ill track him i dono i dono 
ill try 

 you bet ill follow him if its dark huck why he might a found
out he couldnt get his revenge and be going right after that money 

 its so tom its so ill foller him i will by jingoes 

 now youre talking dont you ever weaken huck and i wont 



chapter xxviii

that night tom and huck were ready for their adventure they hung
about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine one watching the
alley at a distance and the other the tavern door nobody entered the
alley or left it nobody resembling the spaniard entered or left the
tavern door the night promised to be a fair one so tom went home with
the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on 
huck was to come and maow whereupon he would slip out and try the
keys but the night remained clear and huck closed his watch and
retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve 

tuesday the boys had the same ill luck also wednesday but thursday
night promised better tom slipped out in good season with his aunts
old tin lantern and a large towel to blindfold it with he hid the
lantern in hucks sugar hogshead and the watch began an hour before
midnight the tavern closed up and its lights the only ones
thereabouts were put out no spaniard had been seen nobody had
entered or left the alley everything was auspicious the blackness of
darkness reigned the perfect stillness was interrupted only by
occasional mutterings of distant thunder 

tom got his lantern lit it in the hogshead wrapped it closely in the
towel and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern 
huck stood sentry and tom felt his way into the alley then there was a
season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon hucks spirits like a
mountain he began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern it
would frighten him but it would at least tell him that tom was alive
yet it seemed hours since tom had disappeared surely he must have
fainted maybe he was dead maybe his heart had burst under terror and
excitement in his uneasiness huck found himself drawing closer and
closer to the alley fearing all sorts of dreadful things and
momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
his breath there was not much to take away for he seemed only able to
inhale it by thimblefuls and his heart would soon wear itself out the
way it was beating suddenly there was a flash of light and tom came
tearing by him run said he run for your life 

he neednt have repeated it once was enough huck was making thirty
or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered the boys
never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter house
at the lower end of the village just as they got within its shelter
the storm burst and the rain poured down as soon as tom got his breath
he said 

 huck it was awful i tried two of the keys just as soft as i could 
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that i couldnt hardly
get my breath i was so scared they wouldnt turn in the lock either 
well without noticing what i was doing i took hold of the knob and
open comes the door it warnt locked i hopped in and shook off the
towel and great caesars ghost 

 what whatd you see tom 

 huck i most stepped onto injun joes hand 

 no 

 yes he was lying there sound asleep on the floor with his old
patch on his eye and his arms spread out 

 lordy what did you do did he wake up 

 no never budged drunk i reckon i just grabbed that towel and
started 

 id never a thought of the towel i bet 

 well i would my aunt would make me mighty sick if i lost it 

 say tom did you see that box 

 huck i didnt wait to look around i didnt see the box i didnt
see the cross i didnt see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the
floor by injun joe yes i saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the
room dont you see now whats the matter with that hanted room 

 how 

 why its hanted with whiskey maybe all the temperance taverns have
got a hanted room hey huck 

 well i reckon maybe thats so whod a thought such a thing but
say tom nows a mighty good time to get that box if injun joes
drunk 

 it is that you try it 

huck shuddered 

 well no i reckon not 

 and i reckon not huck only one bottle alongside of injun joe aint
enough if thered been three hed be drunk enough and id do it 

there was a long pause for reflection and then tom said 

 lookyhere huck less not try that thing any more till we know injun
joes not in there its too scary now if we watch every night well
be dead sure to see him go out some time or other and then well
snatch that box quickern lightning 

 well im agreed ill watch the whole night long and ill do it
every night too if youll do the other part of the job 

 all right i will all you got to do is to trot up hooper street a
block and maow and if im asleep you throw some gravel at the window
and thatll fetch me 

 agreed and good as wheat 

 now huck the storms over and ill go home itll begin to be
daylight in a couple of hours you go back and watch that long will
you 

 i said i would tom and i will ill hant that tavern every night

hes awful hungry he wouldnt want to do as a steady thing 

 well if i dont want you in the daytime ill let you sleep i wont
come bothering around any time you see somethings up in the night 
just skip right around and maow 



chapter xxix

the first thing tom heard on friday morning was a glad piece of news
 judge thatchers family had come back to town the night before both
injun joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment 
and becky took the chief place in the boys interest he saw her and
they had an exhausting good time playing hi spy and gully keeper 
with a crowd of their school mates the day was completed and crowned
in a peculiarly satisfactory way becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long promised and long delayed picnic and she
consented the childs delight was boundless and toms not more
moderate the invitations were sent out before sunset and straightway
the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
and pleasurable anticipation toms excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour and he had good hopes of hearing hucks
 maow and of having his treasure to astonish becky and the picnickers
with next day but he was disappointed no signal came that night 

morning came eventually and by ten or eleven oclock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at judge thatchers and everything
was ready for a start it was not the custom for elderly people to mar
the picnics with their presence the children were considered safe
enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few
young gentlemen of twenty three or thereabouts the old steam ferryboat
was chartered for the occasion presently the gay throng filed up the
main street laden with provision baskets sid was sick and had to miss
the fun mary remained at home to entertain him the last thing mrs 
thatcher said to becky was 

 youll not get back till late perhaps youd better stay all night
with some of the girls that live near the ferry landing child 

 then ill stay with susy harper mamma 

 very well and mind and behave yourself and dont be any trouble 

presently as they tripped along tom said to becky 

 say ill tell you what well do stead of going to joe harpers
well climb right up the hill and stop at the widow douglas shell
have ice cream she has it most every day dead loads of it and shell
be awful glad to have us 

 oh that will be fun 

then becky reflected a moment and said 

 but what will mamma say 

 howll she ever know 

the girl turned the idea over in her mind and said reluctantly 

 i reckon its wrong but 

 but shucks your mother wont know and so whats the harm all she
wants is that youll be safe and i bet you shed a said go there if
shed a thought of it i know she would 

the widow douglas splendid hospitality was a tempting bait it and
toms persuasions presently carried the day so it was decided to say
nothing anybody about the nights programme presently it occurred to
tom that maybe huck might come this very night and give the signal the
thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations still he
could not bear to give up the fun at widow douglas and why should he
give it up he reasoned the signal did not come the night before so
why should it be any more likely to come to night the sure fun of the
evening outweighed the uncertain treasure and boy like he determined
to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
the box of money another time that day 

three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
hollow and tied up the crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
laughter all the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
through with and by and by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
with responsible appetites and then the destruction of the good things
began after the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat
in the shade of spreading oaks by and by somebody shouted 

 whos ready for the cave 

everybody was bundles of candles were procured and straightway there
was a general scamper up the hill the mouth of the cave was up the
hillside an opening shaped like a letter a its massive oaken door
stood unbarred within was a small chamber chilly as an ice house and
walled by nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat 
it was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look
out upon the green valley shining in the sun but the impressiveness of
the situation quickly wore off and the romping began again the moment
a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it a
struggle and a gallant defence followed but the candle was soon
knocked down or blown out and then there was a glad clamor of laughter
and a new chase but all things have an end by and by the procession
went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue the flickering
rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their
point of junction sixty feet overhead this main avenue was not more
than eight or ten feet wide every few steps other lofty and still
narrower crevices branched from it on either hand for mcdougals cave
was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and
out again and led nowhere it was said that one might wander days and
nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms and
never find the end of the cave and that he might go down and down 
and still down into the earth and it was just the same labyrinth
under labyrinth and no end to any of them no man knew the cave 
that was an impossible thing most of the young men knew a portion of
it and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion 
tom sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one 

the procession moved along the main avenue some three quarters of a
mile and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues fly along the dismal corridors and take each other by
surprise at points where the corridors joined again parties were able
to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond
the known ground 

by and by one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
of the cave panting hilarious smeared from head to foot with tallow
drippings daubed with clay and entirely delighted with the success of
the day then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no
note of time and that night was about at hand the clanging bell had
been calling for half an hour however this sort of close to the days
adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory when the ferryboat
with her wild freight pushed into the stream nobody cared sixpence for
the wasted time but the captain of the craft 

huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboats lights went
glinting past the wharf he heard no noise on board for the young
people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
tired to death he wondered what boat it was and why she did not stop
at the wharf and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
attention upon his business the night was growing cloudy and dark ten
oclock came and the noise of vehicles ceased scattered lights began
to wink out all straggling foot passengers disappeared the village
betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
silence and the ghosts eleven oclock came and the tavern lights were
put out darkness everywhere now huck waited what seemed a weary long
time but nothing happened his faith was weakening was there any use 
was there really any use why not give it up and turn in 

a noise fell upon his ear he was all attention in an instant the
alley door closed softly he sprang to the corner of the brick store 
the next moment two men brushed by him and one seemed to have
something under his arm it must be that box so they were going to
remove the treasure why call tom now it would be absurd the men
would get away with the box and never be found again no he would
stick to their wake and follow them he would trust to the darkness for
security from discovery so communing with himself huck stepped out
and glided along behind the men cat like with bare feet allowing
them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible 

they moved up the river street three blocks then turned to the left
up a cross street they went straight ahead then until they came to
the path that led up cardiff hill this they took they passed by the
old welshmans house half way up the hill without hesitating and
still climbed upward good thought huck they will bury it in the old
quarry but they never stopped at the quarry they passed on up the
summit they plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach
bushes and were at once hidden in the gloom huck closed up and
shortened his distance now for they would never be able to see him 
he trotted along awhile then slackened his pace fearing he was
gaining too fast moved on a piece then stopped altogether listened 
no sound none save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own
heart the hooting of an owl came over the hill ominous sound but no
footsteps heavens was everything lost he was about to spring with
winged feet when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him 
hucks heart shot into his throat but he swallowed it again and then
he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at
once and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground he
knew where he was he knew he was within five steps of the stile
leading into widow douglas grounds very well he thought let them
bury it there it wont be hard to find 

now there was a voice a very low voice injun joes 

 damn her maybe shes got company theres lights late as it is 

 i cant see any 

this was that strangers voice the stranger of the haunted house a
deadly chill went to hucks heart this then was the revenge job 
his thought was to fly then he remembered that the widow douglas had
been kind to him more than once and maybe these men were going to
murder her he wished he dared venture to warn her but he knew he
didnt dare they might come and catch him he thought all this and
more in the moment that elapsed between the strangers remark and injun
joes next which was 

 because the bush is in your way now this way now you see dont
you 

 yes well there is company there i reckon better give it up 

 give it up and i just leaving this country forever give it up and
maybe never have another chance i tell you again as ive told you
before i dont care for her swag you may have it but her husband was
rough on me many times he was rough on me and mainly he was the
justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant and that aint all 
it aint a millionth part of it he had me horsewhipped horsewhipped
in front of the jail like a nigger with all the town looking on 
horsewhipped do you understand he took advantage of me and died but
ill take it out of her 

 oh dont kill her dont do that 

 kill who said anything about killing i would kill him if he was
here but not her when you want to get revenge on a woman you dont
kill her bosh you go for her looks you slit her nostrils you notch
her ears like a sow 

 by god thats 

 keep your opinion to yourself it will be safest for you ill tie
her to the bed if she bleeds to death is that my fault ill not cry 
if she does my friend youll help me in this thing for my sake
 thats why youre here i mightnt be able alone if you flinch ill
kill you do you understand that and if i have to kill you ill kill
her and then i reckon nobodyll ever know much about who done this
business 

 well if its got to be done lets get at it the quicker the
better im all in a shiver 

 do it now and company there look here ill get suspicious of you 
first thing you know no well wait till the lights are out theres
no hurry 

huck felt that a silence was going to ensue a thing still more awful
than any amount of murderous talk so he held his breath and stepped
gingerly back planted his foot carefully and firmly after balancing 
one legged in a precarious way and almost toppling over first on one
side and then on the other he took another step back with the same
elaboration and the same risks then another and another and a twig
snapped under his foot his breath stopped and he listened there was
no sound the stillness was perfect his gratitude was measureless now
he turned in his tracks between the walls of sumach bushes turned
himself as carefully as if he were a ship and then stepped quickly but
cautiously along when he emerged at the quarry he felt secure and so
he picked up his nimble heels and flew down down he sped till he
reached the welshmans he banged at the door and presently the heads
of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows 

 whats the row there whos banging what do you want 

 let me in quick ill tell everything 

 why who are you 

 huckleberry finn quick let me in 

 huckleberry finn indeed it aint a name to open many doors i
judge but let him in lads and lets see whats the trouble 

 please dont ever tell i told you were hucks first words when he
got in please dont id be killed sure but the widows been good
friends to me sometimes and i want to tell i will tell if youll
promise you wont ever say it was me 

 by george he has got something to tell or he wouldnt act so 
exclaimed the old man out with it and nobody herell ever tell lad 

three minutes later the old man and his sons well armed were up the
hill and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe their weapons in
their hands huck accompanied them no further he hid behind a great
bowlder and fell to listening there was a lagging anxious silence 
and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry 

huck waited for no particulars he sprang away and sped down the hill
as fast as his legs could carry him 



chapter xxx

as the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on sunday morning huck
came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old welshmans door 
the inmates were asleep but it was a sleep that was set on a
hair trigger on account of the exciting episode of the night a call
came from a window 

 whos there 

hucks scared voice answered in a low tone 

 please let me in its only huck finn 

 its a name that can open this door night or day lad and welcome 

these were strange words to the vagabond boys ears and the
pleasantest he had ever heard he could not recollect that the closing
word had ever been applied in his case before the door was quickly
unlocked and he entered huck was given a seat and the old man and his
brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves 

 now my boy i hope youre good and hungry because breakfast will be
ready as soon as the suns up and well have a piping hot one too
 make yourself easy about that i and the boys hoped youd turn up and
stop here last night 

 i was awful scared said huck and i run i took out when the
pistols went off and i didnt stop for three mile ive come now becuz
i wanted to know about it you know and i come before daylight becuz i
didnt want to run across them devils even if they was dead 

 well poor chap you do look as if youd had a hard night of it but
theres a bed here for you when youve had your breakfast no they
aint dead lad we are sorry enough for that you see we knew right
where to put our hands on them by your description so we crept along
on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them dark as a cellar
that sumach path was and just then i found i was going to sneeze it
was the meanest kind of luck i tried to keep it back but no use
 twas bound to come and it did come i was in the lead with my pistol
raised and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a rustling to get
out of the path i sung out fire boys and blazed away at the place
where the rustling was so did the boys but they were off in a jiffy 
those villains and we after them down through the woods i judge we
never touched them they fired a shot apiece as they started but their
bullets whizzed by and didnt do us any harm as soon as we lost the
sound of their feet we quit chasing and went down and stirred up the
constables they got a posse together and went off to guard the river
bank and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to
beat up the woods my boys will be with them presently i wish we had
some sort of description of those rascals twould help a good deal 
but you couldnt see what they were like in the dark lad i suppose 

 oh yes i saw them down town and follered them 

 splendid describe them describe them my boy 

 ones the old deaf and dumb spaniard thats ben around here once or
twice and tothers a mean looking ragged 

 thats enough lad we know the men happened on them in the woods
back of the widows one day and they slunk away off with you boys 
and tell the sheriff get your breakfast to morrow morning 

the welshmans sons departed at once as they were leaving the room
huck sprang up and exclaimed 

 oh please dont tell anybody it was me that blowed on them oh 
please 

 all right if you say it huck but you ought to have the credit of
what you did 

 oh no no please dont tell 

when the young men were gone the old welshman said 

 they wont tell and i wont but why dont you want it known 

huck would not explain further than to say that he already knew too
much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he
knew anything against him for the whole world he would be killed for
knowing it sure 

the old man promised secrecy once more and said 

 how did you come to follow these fellows lad were they looking
suspicious 

huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply then he said 

 well you see im a kind of a hard lot least everybody says so 
and i dont see nothing agin it and sometimes i cant sleep much on
account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way
of doing that was the way of it last night i couldnt sleep and so i
come along up street bout midnight a turning it all over and when i
got to that old shackly brick store by the temperance tavern i backed
up agin the wall to have another think well just then along comes
these two chaps slipping along close by me with something under their
arm and i reckoned theyd stole it one was a smoking and tother one
wanted a light so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
their faces and i see that the big one was the deaf and dumb spaniard 
by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye and tother one was a
rusty ragged looking devil 

 could you see the rags by the light of the cigars 

this staggered huck for a moment then he said 

 well i dont know but somehow it seems as if i did 

 then they went on and you 

 follered em yes that was it i wanted to see what was up they
sneaked along so i dogged em to the widders stile and stood in the
dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder and the spaniard
swear hed spile her looks just as i told you and your two 

 what the deaf and dumb man said all that 

huck had made another terrible mistake he was trying his best to keep
the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the spaniard might
be and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in
spite of all he could do he made several efforts to creep out of his
scrape but the old mans eye was upon him and he made blunder after
blunder presently the welshman said 

 my boy dont be afraid of me i wouldnt hurt a hair of your head
for all the world no id protect you id protect you this spaniard
is not deaf and dumb youve let that slip without intending it you
cant cover that up now you know something about that spaniard that
you want to keep dark now trust me tell me what it is and trust me
 i wont betray you 

huck looked into the old mans honest eyes a moment then bent over
and whispered in his ear 

 taint a spaniard its injun joe 

the welshman almost jumped out of his chair in a moment he said 

 its all plain enough now when you talked about notching ears and
slitting noses i judged that that was your own embellishment because
white men dont take that sort of revenge but an injun thats a
different matter altogether 

during breakfast the talk went on and in the course of it the old man
said that the last thing which he and his sons had done before going
to bed was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
marks of blood they found none but captured a bulky bundle of 

 of what 

if the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
stunning suddenness from hucks blanched lips his eyes were staring
wide now and his breath suspended waiting for the answer the
welshman started stared in return three seconds five seconds ten
 then replied 

 of burglars tools why whats the matter with you 

huck sank back panting gently but deeply unutterably grateful the
welshman eyed him gravely curiously and presently said 

 yes burglars tools that appears to relieve you a good deal but
what did give you that turn what were you expecting wed found 

huck was in a close place the inquiring eye was upon him he would
have given anything for material for a plausible answer nothing
suggested itself the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper a
senseless reply offered there was no time to weigh it so at a venture
he uttered it feebly 

 sunday school books maybe 

poor huck was too distressed to smile but the old man laughed loud
and joyously shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot 
and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a mans pocket 
because it cut down the doctors bill like everything then he added 

 poor old chap youre white and jaded you aint well a bit no
wonder youre a little flighty and off your balance but youll come
out of it rest and sleep will fetch you out all right i hope 

huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such
a suspicious excitement for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
brought from the tavern was the treasure as soon as he had heard the
talk at the widows stile he had only thought it was not the treasure 
however he had not known that it wasnt and so the suggestion of a
captured bundle was too much for his self possession but on the whole
he felt glad the little episode had happened for now he knew beyond
all question that that bundle was not the bundle and so his mind was
at rest and exceedingly comfortable in fact everything seemed to be
drifting just in the right direction now the treasure must be still
in no the men would be captured and jailed that day and he and tom
could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
interruption 

just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door huck
jumped for a hiding place for he had no mind to be connected even
remotely with the late event the welshman admitted several ladies and
gentlemen among them the widow douglas and noticed that groups of
citizens were climbing up the hill to stare at the stile so the news
had spread the welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
visitors the widows gratitude for her preservation was outspoken 

 dont say a word about it madam theres another that youre more
beholden to than you are to me and my boys maybe but he dont allow
me to tell his name we wouldnt have been there but for him 

of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled
the main matter but the welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of
his visitors and through them be transmitted to the whole town for he
refused to part with his secret when all else had been learned the
widow said 

 i went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
noise why didnt you come and wake me 

 we judged it warnt worth while those fellows warnt likely to come
again they hadnt any tools left to work with and what was the use of
waking you up and scaring you to death my three negro men stood guard
at your house all the rest of the night theyve just come back 

more visitors came and the story had to be told and retold for a
couple of hours more 

there was no sabbath school during day school vacation but everybody
was early at church the stirring event was well canvassed news came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered when the
sermon was finished judge thatchers wife dropped alongside of mrs 
harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said 

 is my becky going to sleep all day i just expected she would be
tired to death 

 your becky 

 yes with a startled look didnt she stay with you last night 

 why no 

mrs thatcher turned pale and sank into a pew just as aunt polly 
talking briskly with a friend passed by aunt polly said 

 good morning mrs thatcher good morning mrs harper ive got a
boy thats turned up missing i reckon my tom stayed at your house last
night one of you and now hes afraid to come to church ive got to
settle with him 

mrs thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever 

 he didnt stay with us said mrs harper beginning to look uneasy 
a marked anxiety came into aunt pollys face 

 joe harper have you seen my tom this morning 

 nom 

 when did you see him last 

joe tried to remember but was not sure he could say the people had
stopped moving out of church whispers passed along and a boding
uneasiness took possession of every countenance children were
anxiously questioned and young teachers they all said they had not
noticed whether tom and becky were on board the ferryboat on the
homeward trip it was dark no one thought of inquiring if any one was
missing one young man finally blurted out his fear that they were
still in the cave mrs thatcher swooned away aunt polly fell to
crying and wringing her hands 

the alarm swept from lip to lip from group to group from street to
street and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the
whole town was up the cardiff hill episode sank into instant
insignificance the burglars were forgotten horses were saddled 
skiffs were manned the ferryboat ordered out and before the horror
was half an hour old two hundred men were pouring down highroad and
river toward the cave 

all the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead many women
visited aunt polly and mrs thatcher and tried to comfort them they
cried with them too and that was still better than words all the
tedious night the town waited for news but when the morning dawned at
last all the word that came was send more candles and send food 
mrs thatcher was almost crazed and aunt polly also judge thatcher
sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave but they
conveyed no real cheer 

the old welshman came home toward daylight spattered with
candle grease smeared with clay and almost worn out he found huck
still in the bed that had been provided for him and delirious with
fever the physicians were all at the cave so the widow douglas came
and took charge of the patient she said she would do her best by him 
because whether he was good bad or indifferent he was the lords 
and nothing that was the lords was a thing to be neglected the
welshman said huck had good spots in him and the widow said 

 you can depend on it thats the lords mark he dont leave it off 
he never does puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
hands 

early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
village but the strongest of the citizens continued searching all the
news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were
being ransacked that had never been visited before that every corner
and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched that wherever one
wandered through the maze of passages lights were to be seen flitting
hither and thither in the distance and shoutings and pistol shots sent
their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles in one
place far from the section usually traversed by tourists the names
 becky tom had been found traced upon the rocky wall with
candle smoke and near at hand a grease soiled bit of ribbon mrs 
thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it she said it was the
last relic she should ever have of her child and that no other memorial
of her could ever be so precious because this one parted latest from
the living body before the awful death came some said that now and
then in the cave a far away speck of light would glimmer and then a
glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the
echoing aisle and then a sickening disappointment always followed the
children were not there it was only a searchers light 

three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along and
the village sank into a hopeless stupor no one had heart for anything 
the accidental discovery just made that the proprietor of the
temperance tavern kept liquor on his premises scarcely fluttered the
public pulse tremendous as the fact was in a lucid interval huck
feebly led up to the subject of taverns and finally asked dimly
dreading the worst if anything had been discovered at the temperance
tavern since he had been ill 

 yes said the widow 

huck started up in bed wild eyed 

 what what was it 

 liquor and the place has been shut up lie down child what a turn
you did give me 

 only tell me just one thing only just one please was it tom sawyer
that found it 

the widow burst into tears hush hush child hush ive told you
before you must not talk you are very very sick 

then nothing but liquor had been found there would have been a great
powwow if it had been the gold so the treasure was gone forever gone
forever but what could she be crying about curious that she should
cry 

these thoughts worked their dim way through hucks mind and under the
weariness they gave him he fell asleep the widow said to herself 

 there hes asleep poor wreck tom sawyer find it pity but somebody
could find tom sawyer ah there aint many left now thats got hope
enough or strength enough either to go on searching 



chapter xxxi

now to return to tom and beckys share in the picnic they tripped
along the murky aisles with the rest of the company visiting the
familiar wonders of the cave wonders dubbed with rather
over descriptive names such as the drawing room the cathedral 
 aladdins palace and so on presently the hide and seek frolicking
began and tom and becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion
began to grow a trifle wearisome then they wandered down a sinuous
avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled web work of
names dates post office addresses and mottoes with which the rocky
walls had been frescoed in candle smoke still drifting along and
talking they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave
whose walls were not frescoed they smoked their own names under an
overhanging shelf and moved on presently they came to a place where a
little stream of water trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone
sediment with it had in the slow dragging ages formed a laced and
ruffled niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone tom squeezed his
small body behind it in order to illuminate it for beckys
gratification he found that it curtained a sort of steep natural
stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls and at once the
ambition to be a discoverer seized him becky responded to his call 
and they made a smoke mark for future guidance and started upon their
quest they wound this way and that far down into the secret depths of
the cave made another mark and branched off in search of novelties to
tell the upper world about in one place they found a spacious cavern 
from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the
length and circumference of a mans leg they walked all about it 
wondering and admiring and presently left it by one of the numerous
passages that opened into it this shortly brought them to a bewitching
spring whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering
crystals it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by
many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great
stalactites and stalagmites together the result of the ceaseless
water drip of centuries under the roof vast knots of bats had packed
themselves together thousands in a bunch the lights disturbed the
creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds squeaking and
darting furiously at the candles tom knew their ways and the danger of
this sort of conduct he seized beckys hand and hurried her into the
first corridor that offered and none too soon for a bat struck
beckys light out with its wing while she was passing out of the
cavern the bats chased the children a good distance but the fugitives
plunged into every new passage that offered and at last got rid of the
perilous things tom found a subterranean lake shortly which
stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows 
he wanted to explore its borders but concluded that it would be best
to sit down and rest awhile first now for the first time the deep
stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the
children becky said 

 why i didnt notice but it seems ever so long since i heard any of
the others 

 come to think becky we are away down below them and i dont know
how far away north or south or east or whichever it is we couldnt
hear them here 

becky grew apprehensive 

 i wonder how long weve been down here tom we better start back 

 yes i reckon we better praps we better 

 can you find the way tom its all a mixed up crookedness to me 

 i reckon i could find it but then the bats if they put our candles
out it will be an awful fix lets try some other way so as not to go
through there 

 well but i hope we wont get lost it would be so awful and the
girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities 

they started through a corridor and traversed it in silence a long
way glancing at each new opening to see if there was anything
familiar about the look of it but they were all strange every time
tom made an examination becky would watch his face for an encouraging
sign and he would say cheerily 

 oh its all right this aint the one but well come to it right
away 

but he felt less and less hopeful with each failure and presently
began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random in desperate
hope of finding the one that was wanted he still said it was all
right but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words
had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said all is lost 
becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear and tried hard to keep
back the tears but they would come at last she said 

 oh tom never mind the bats lets go back that way we seem to get
worse and worse off all the time 

 listen said he 

profound silence silence so deep that even their breathings were
conspicuous in the hush tom shouted the call went echoing down the
empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that
resembled a ripple of mocking laughter 

 oh dont do it again tom it is too horrid said becky 

 it is horrid but i better becky they might hear us you know and
he shouted again 

the might was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter it
so confessed a perishing hope the children stood still and listened 
but there was no result tom turned upon the back track at once and
hurried his steps it was but a little while before a certain
indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to becky he
could not find his way back 

 oh tom you didnt make any marks 

 becky i was such a fool such a fool i never thought we might want
to come back no i cant find the way its all mixed up 

 tom tom were lost were lost we never can get out of this awful
place oh why did we ever leave the others 

she sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that tom
was appalled with the idea that she might die or lose her reason he
sat down by her and put his arms around her she buried her face in his
bosom she clung to him she poured out her terrors her unavailing
regrets and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter tom
begged her to pluck up hope again and she said she could not he fell
to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable
situation this had a better effect she said she would try to hope
again she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
would not talk like that any more for he was no more to blame than
she she said 

so they moved on again aimlessly simply at random all they could do
was to move keep moving for a little while hope made a show of
reviving not with any reason to back it but only because it is its
nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age
and familiarity with failure 

by and by tom took beckys candle and blew it out this economy meant
so much words were not needed becky understood and her hope died
again she knew that tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in
his pockets yet he must economize 

by and by fatigue began to assert its claims the children tried to
pay attention for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time
was grown to be so precious moving in some direction in any
direction was at least progress and might bear fruit but to sit down
was to invite death and shorten its pursuit 

at last beckys frail limbs refused to carry her farther she sat
down tom rested with her and they talked of home and the friends
there and the comfortable beds and above all the light becky cried 
and tom tried to think of some way of comforting her but all his
encouragements were grown threadbare with use and sounded like
sarcasms fatigue bore so heavily upon becky that she drowsed off to
sleep tom was grateful he sat looking into her drawn face and saw it
grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams and
by and by a smile dawned and rested there the peaceful face reflected
somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit and his thoughts
wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories while he was deep in
his musings becky woke up with a breezy little laugh but it was
stricken dead upon her lips and a groan followed it 

 oh how could i sleep i wish i never never had waked no no i
dont tom dont look so i wont say it again 

 im glad youve slept becky youll feel rested now and well find
the way out 

 we can try tom but ive seen such a beautiful country in my dream 
i reckon we are going there 

 maybe not maybe not cheer up becky and lets go on trying 

they rose up and wandered along hand in hand and hopeless they tried
to estimate how long they had been in the cave but all they knew was
that it seemed days and weeks and yet it was plain that this could not
be for their candles were not gone yet a long time after this they
could not tell how long tom said they must go softly and listen for
dripping water they must find a spring they found one presently and
tom said it was time to rest again both were cruelly tired yet becky
said she thought she could go a little farther she was surprised to
hear tom dissent she could not understand it they sat down and tom
fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay 
thought was soon busy nothing was said for some time then becky broke
the silence 

 tom i am so hungry 

tom took something out of his pocket 

 do you remember this said he 

becky almost smiled 

 its our wedding cake tom 

 yes i wish it was as big as a barrel for its all weve got 

 i saved it from the picnic for us to dream on tom the way grown up
people do with wedding cake but itll be our 

she dropped the sentence where it was tom divided the cake and becky
ate with good appetite while tom nibbled at his moiety there was
abundance of cold water to finish the feast with by and by becky
suggested that they move on again tom was silent a moment then he
said 

 becky can you bear it if i tell you something 

beckys face paled but she thought she could 

 well then becky we must stay here where theres water to drink 
that little piece is our last candle 

becky gave loose to tears and wailings tom did what he could to
comfort her but with little effect at length becky said 

 tom 

 well becky 

 theyll miss us and hunt for us 

 yes they will certainly they will 

 maybe theyre hunting for us now tom 

 why i reckon maybe they are i hope they are 

 when would they miss us tom 

 when they get back to the boat i reckon 

 tom it might be dark then would they notice we hadnt come 

 i dont know but anyway your mother would miss you as soon as they
got home 

a frightened look in beckys face brought tom to his senses and he saw
that he had made a blunder becky was not to have gone home that night 
the children became silent and thoughtful in a moment a new burst of
grief from becky showed tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers
also that the sabbath morning might be half spent before mrs thatcher
discovered that becky was not at mrs harpers 

the children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched
it melt slowly and pitilessly away saw the half inch of wick stand
alone at last saw the feeble flame rise and fall climb the thin
column of smoke linger at its top a moment and then the horror of
utter darkness reigned 

how long afterward it was that becky came to a slow consciousness that
she was crying in toms arms neither could tell all that they knew
was that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time both awoke out of
a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more tom said
it might be sunday now maybe monday he tried to get becky to talk 
but her sorrows were too oppressive all her hopes were gone tom said
that they must have been missed long ago and no doubt the search was
going on he would shout and maybe some one would come he tried it 
but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he
tried it no more 

the hours wasted away and hunger came to torment the captives again 
a portion of toms half of the cake was left they divided and ate it 
but they seemed hungrier than before the poor morsel of food only
whetted desire 

by and by tom said 

 sh did you hear that 

both held their breath and listened there was a sound like the
faintest far off shout instantly tom answered it and leading becky
by the hand started groping down the corridor in its direction 
presently he listened again again the sound was heard and apparently
a little nearer 

 its them said tom theyre coming come along becky were all
right now 

the joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming their speed was
slow however because pitfalls were somewhat common and had to be
guarded against they shortly came to one and had to stop it might be
three feet deep it might be a hundred there was no passing it at any
rate tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could 
no bottom they must stay there and wait until the searchers came they
listened evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant a
moment or two more and they had gone altogether the heart sinking
misery of it tom whooped until he was hoarse but it was of no use he
talked hopefully to becky but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
sounds came again 

the children groped their way back to the spring the weary time
dragged on they slept again and awoke famished and woe stricken tom
believed it must be tuesday by this time 

now an idea struck him there were some side passages near at hand it
would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the
heavy time in idleness he took a kite line from his pocket tied it to
a projection and he and becky started tom in the lead unwinding the
line as he groped along at the end of twenty steps the corridor ended
in a jumping off place tom got down on his knees and felt below and
then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands
conveniently he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the
right and at that moment not twenty yards away a human hand holding
a candle appeared from behind a rock tom lifted up a glorious shout 
and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to injun
joes tom was paralyzed he could not move he was vastly gratified
the next moment to see the spaniard take to his heels and get
himself out of sight tom wondered that joe had not recognized his
voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court but the
echoes must have disguised the voice without doubt that was it he
reasoned toms fright weakened every muscle in his body he said to
himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he
would stay there and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of
meeting injun joe again he was careful to keep from becky what it was
he had seen he told her he had only shouted for luck 

but hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run 
another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought
changes the children awoke tortured with a raging hunger tom believed
that it must be wednesday or thursday or even friday or saturday now 
and that the search had been given over he proposed to explore another
passage he felt willing to risk injun joe and all other terrors but
becky was very weak she had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be
roused she said she would wait now where she was and die it would
not be long she told tom to go with the kite line and explore if he
chose but she implored him to come back every little while and speak
to her and she made him promise that when the awful time came he
would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over 

tom kissed her with a choking sensation in his throat and made a
show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the
cave then he took the kite line in his hand and went groping down one
of the passages on his hands and knees distressed with hunger and sick
with bodings of coming doom 



chapter xxxii

tuesday afternoon came and waned to the twilight the village of st 
petersburg still mourned the lost children had not been found public
prayers had been offered up for them and many and many a private
prayer that had the petitioners whole heart in it but still no good
news came from the cave the majority of the searchers had given up the
quest and gone back to their daily avocations saying that it was plain
the children could never be found mrs thatcher was very ill and a
great part of the time delirious people said it was heartbreaking to
hear her call her child and raise her head and listen a whole minute
at a time then lay it wearily down again with a moan aunt polly had
drooped into a settled melancholy and her gray hair had grown almost
white the village went to its rest on tuesday night sad and forlorn 

away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
bells and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half clad
people who shouted turn out turn out theyre found theyre
found tin pans and horns were added to the din the population massed
itself and moved toward the river met the children coming in an open
carriage drawn by shouting citizens thronged around it joined its
homeward march and swept magnificently up the main street roaring
huzzah after huzzah 

the village was illuminated nobody went to bed again it was the
greatest night the little town had ever seen during the first half hour
a procession of villagers filed through judge thatchers house seized
the saved ones and kissed them squeezed mrs thatchers hand tried to
speak but couldnt and drifted out raining tears all over the place 

aunt pollys happiness was complete and mrs thatchers nearly so it
would be complete however as soon as the messenger dispatched with
the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband tom lay
upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of
the wonderful adventure putting in many striking additions to adorn it
withal and closed with a description of how he left becky and went on
an exploring expedition how he followed two avenues as far as his
kite line would reach how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of
the kite line and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far off
speck that looked like daylight dropped the line and groped toward it 
pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole and saw the broad
mississippi rolling by and if it had only happened to be night he would
not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that
passage any more he told how he went back for becky and broke the good
news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff for she was
tired and knew she was going to die and wanted to he described how he
labored with her and convinced her and how she almost died for joy when
she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight how
he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out how they sat
there and cried for gladness how some men came along in a skiff and tom
hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition 
how the men didnt believe the wild tale at first because said they 
 you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in 
 then took them aboard rowed to a house gave them supper made them
rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home 

before day dawn judge thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
were tracked out in the cave by the twine clews they had strung
behind them and informed of the great news 

three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be
shaken off at once as tom and becky soon discovered they were
bedridden all of wednesday and thursday and seemed to grow more and
more tired and worn all the time tom got about a little on
thursday was down town friday and nearly as whole as ever saturday 
but becky did not leave her room until sunday and then she looked as
if she had passed through a wasting illness 

tom learned of hucks sickness and went to see him on friday but
could not be admitted to the bedroom neither could he on saturday or
sunday he was admitted daily after that but was warned to keep still
about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic the widow douglas
stayed by to see that he obeyed at home tom learned of the cardiff
hill event also that the ragged mans body had eventually been found
in the river near the ferry landing he had been drowned while trying
to escape perhaps 

about a fortnight after toms rescue from the cave he started off to
visit huck who had grown plenty strong enough now to hear exciting
talk and tom had some that would interest him he thought judge
thatchers house was on toms way and he stopped to see becky the
judge and some friends set tom to talking and some one asked him
ironically if he wouldnt like to go to the cave again tom said he
thought he wouldnt mind it the judge said 

 well there are others just like you tom ive not the least doubt 
but we have taken care of that nobody will get lost in that cave any
more 

 why 

 because i had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago 
and triple locked and ive got the keys 

tom turned as white as a sheet 

 whats the matter boy here run somebody fetch a glass of water 

the water was brought and thrown into toms face 

 ah now youre all right what was the matter with you tom 

 oh judge injun joes in the cave 



chapter xxxiii

within a few minutes the news had spread and a dozen skiff loads of
men were on their way to mcdougals cave and the ferryboat well
filled with passengers soon followed tom sawyer was in the skiff that
bore judge thatcher 

when the cave door was unlocked a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place injun joe lay stretched upon the ground 
dead with his face close to the crack of the door as if his longing
eyes had been fixed to the latest moment upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside tom was touched for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered his pity was moved but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security now 
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody minded outcast 

injun joes bowie knife lay close by its blade broken in two the
great foundation beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through 
with tedious labor useless labor too it was for the native rock
formed a sill outside it and upon that stubborn material the knife had
wrought no effect the only damage done was to the knife itself but if
there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been
useless still for if the beam had been wholly cut away injun joe could
not have squeezed his body under the door and he knew it so he had
only hacked that place in order to be doing something in order to pass
the weary time in order to employ his tortured faculties ordinarily
one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices
of this vestibule left there by tourists but there were none now the
prisoner had searched them out and eaten them he had also contrived to
catch a few bats and these also he had eaten leaving only their
claws the poor unfortunate had starved to death in one place near at
hand a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages 
builded by the water drip from a stalactite overhead the captive had
broken off the stalagmite and upon the stump had placed a stone 
wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop
that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a
clock tick a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours that drop
was falling when the pyramids were new when troy fell when the
foundations of rome were laid when christ was crucified when the
conqueror created the british empire when columbus sailed when the
massacre at lexington was news it is falling now it will still be
falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of
history and the twilight of tradition and been swallowed up in the
thick night of oblivion has everything a purpose and a mission did
this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for
this flitting human insects need and has it another important object
to accomplish ten thousand years to come no matter it is many and
many a year since the hapless half breed scooped out the stone to catch
the priceless drops but to this day the tourist stares longest at that
pathetic stone and that slow dropping water when he comes to see the
wonders of mcdougals cave injun joes cup stands first in the list of
the caverns marvels even aladdins palace cannot rival it 

injun joe was buried near the mouth of the cave and people flocked
there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
hamlets for seven miles around they brought their children and all
sorts of provisions and confessed that they had had almost as
satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
hanging 

this funeral stopped the further growth of one thing the petition to
the governor for injun joes pardon the petition had been largely
signed many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held and a
committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail
around the governor and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample
his duty under foot injun joe was believed to have killed five
citizens of the village but what of that if he had been satan himself
there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names
to a pardon petition and drip a tear on it from their permanently
impaired and leaky water works 

the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have
an important talk huck had learned all about toms adventure from the
welshman and the widow douglas by this time but tom said he reckoned
there was one thing they had not told him that thing was what he
wanted to talk about now hucks face saddened he said 

 i know what it is you got into no and never found anything but
whiskey nobody told me it was you but i just knowed it must a ben
you soon as i heard bout that whiskey business and i knowed you
hadnt got the money becuz youd a got at me some way or other and
told me even if you was mum to everybody else tom somethings always
told me wed never get holt of that swag 

 why huck i never told on that tavern keeper you know his tavern
was all right the saturday i went to the picnic dont you remember you
was to watch there that night 

 oh yes why it seems bout a year ago it was that very night that i
follered injun joe to the widders 

 you followed him 

 yes but you keep mum i reckon injun joes left friends behind him 
and i dont want em souring on me and doing me mean tricks if it
hadnt ben for me hed be down in texas now all right 

then huck told his entire adventure in confidence to tom who had only
heard of the welshmans part of it before 

 well said huck presently coming back to the main question 
 whoever nipped the whiskey in no nipped the money too i reckon
 anyways its a goner for us tom 

 huck that money wasnt ever in no 

 what huck searched his comrades face keenly tom have you got on
the track of that money again 

 huck its in the cave 

hucks eyes blazed 

 say it again tom 

 the moneys in the cave 

 tom honest injun now is it fun or earnest 

 earnest huck just as earnest as ever i was in my life will you go
in there with me and help get it out 

 i bet i will i will if its where we can blaze our way to it and not
get lost 

 huck we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
world 

 good as wheat what makes you think the moneys 

 huck you just wait till we get in there if we dont find it ill
agree to give you my drum and every thing ive got in the world i
will by jings 

 all right its a whiz when do you say 

 right now if you say it are you strong enough 

 is it far in the cave i ben on my pins a little three or four days 
now but i cant walk moren a mile tom least i dont think i could 

 its about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go 
huck but theres a mighty short cut that they dont anybody but me
know about huck ill take you right to it in a skiff ill float the
skiff down there and ill pull it back again all by myself you
neednt ever turn your hand over 

 less start right off tom 

 all right we want some bread and meat and our pipes and a little
bag or two and two or three kite strings and some of these
new fangled things they call lucifer matches i tell you manys
the time i wished i had some when i was in there before 

a trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
was absent and got under way at once when they were several miles
below cave hollow tom said 

 now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
cave hollow no houses no wood yards bushes all alike but do you see
that white place up yonder where theres been a landslide well thats
one of my marks well get ashore now 

they landed 

 now huck where were a standing you could touch that hole i got out
of with a fishing pole see if you can find it 

huck searched all the place about and found nothing tom proudly
marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said 

 here you are look at it huck its the snuggest hole in this
country you just keep mum about it all along ive been wanting to be
a robber but i knew id got to have a thing like this and where to
run across it was the bother weve got it now and well keep it
quiet only well let joe harper and ben rogers in because of course
theres got to be a gang or else there wouldnt be any style about it 
tom sawyers gang it sounds splendid dont it huck 

 well it just does tom and wholl we rob 

 oh most anybody waylay people thats mostly the way 

 and kill them 

 no not always hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom 

 whats a ransom 

 money you make them raise all they can offn their friends and
after youve kept them a year if it aint raised then you kill them 
thats the general way only you dont kill the women you shut up the
women but you dont kill them theyre always beautiful and rich and
awfully scared you take their watches and things but you always take
your hat off and talk polite they aint anybody as polite as robbers
 youll see that in any book well the women get to loving you and
after theyve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and
after that you couldnt get them to leave if you drove them out theyd
turn right around and come back its so in all the books 

 why its real bully tom i believe its bettern to be a pirate 

 yes its better in some ways because its close to home and
circuses and all that 

by this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole tom
in the lead they toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel 
then made their spliced kite strings fast and moved on a few steps
brought them to the spring and tom felt a shudder quiver all through
him he showed huck the fragment of candle wick perched on a lump of
clay against the wall and described how he and becky had watched the
flame struggle and expire 

the boys began to quiet down to whispers now for the stillness and
gloom of the place oppressed their spirits they went on and presently
entered and followed toms other corridor until they reached the
 jumping off place the candles revealed the fact that it was not
really a precipice but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
high tom whispered 

 now ill show you something huck 

he held his candle aloft and said 

 look as far around the corner as you can do you see that there on
the big rock over yonder done with candle smoke 

 tom its a cross 

 now wheres your number two under the cross hey right yonders
where i saw injun joe poke up his candle huck 

huck stared at the mystic sign awhile and then said with a shaky voice 

 tom less git out of here 

 what and leave the treasure 

 yes leave it injun joes ghost is round about there certain 

 no it aint huck no it aint it would hant the place where he
died away out at the mouth of the cave five mile from here 

 no tom it wouldnt it would hang round the money i know the ways
of ghosts and so do you 

tom began to fear that huck was right misgivings gathered in his
mind but presently an idea occurred to him 

 lookyhere huck what fools were making of ourselves injun joes
ghost aint a going to come around where theres a cross 

the point was well taken it had its effect 

 tom i didnt think of that but thats so its luck for us that
cross is i reckon well climb down there and have a hunt for that box 

tom went first cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended 
huck followed four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
great rock stood in the boys examined three of them with no result 
they found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock with
a pallet of blankets spread down in it also an old suspender some
bacon rind and the well gnawed bones of two or three fowls but there
was no money box the lads searched and researched this place but in
vain tom said 

 he said under the cross well this comes nearest to being under the
cross it cant be under the rock itself because that sets solid on
the ground 

they searched everywhere once more and then sat down discouraged 
huck could suggest nothing by and by tom said 

 lookyhere huck theres footprints and some candle grease on the
clay about one side of this rock but not on the other sides now 
whats that for i bet you the money is under the rock im going to
dig in the clay 

 that aint no bad notion tom said huck with animation 

toms real barlow was out at once and he had not dug four inches
before he struck wood 

 hey huck you hear that 

huck began to dig and scratch now some boards were soon uncovered and
removed they had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock 
tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he
could but said he could not see to the end of the rift he proposed to
explore he stooped and passed under the narrow way descended
gradually he followed its winding course first to the right then to
the left huck at his heels tom turned a short curve by and by and
exclaimed 

 my goodness huck lookyhere 

it was the treasure box sure enough occupying a snug little cavern 
along with an empty powder keg a couple of guns in leather cases two
or three pairs of old moccasins a leather belt and some other rubbish
well soaked with the water drip 

 got it at last said huck ploughing among the tarnished coins with
his hand my but were rich tom 

 huck i always reckoned wed get it its just too good to believe 
but we have got it sure say lets not fool around here lets snake
it out lemme see if i can lift the box 

it weighed about fifty pounds tom could lift it after an awkward
fashion but could not carry it conveniently 

 i thought so he said they carried it like it was heavy that day
at the hanted house i noticed that i reckon i was right to think of
fetching the little bags along 

the money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross
rock 

 now less fetch the guns and things said huck 

 no huck leave them there theyre just the tricks to have when we
go to robbing well keep them there all the time and well hold our
orgies there too its an awful snug place for orgies 

 what orgies 

 i dono but robbers always have orgies and of course weve got to
have them too come along huck weve been in here a long time its
getting late i reckon im hungry too well eat and smoke when we
get to the skiff 

they presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes looked warily
out found the coast clear and were soon lunching and smoking in the
skiff as the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got
under way tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight chatting
cheerily with huck and landed shortly after dark 

 now huck said tom well hide the money in the loft of the
widows woodshed and ill come up in the morning and well count it
and divide and then well hunt up a place out in the woods for it
where it will be safe just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till
i run and hook benny taylors little wagon i wont be gone a minute 

he disappeared and presently returned with the wagon put the two
small sacks into it threw some old rags on top of them and started
off dragging his cargo behind him when the boys reached the
welshmans house they stopped to rest just as they were about to move
on the welshman stepped out and said 

 hallo whos that 

 huck and tom sawyer 

 good come along with me boys you are keeping everybody waiting 
here hurry up trot ahead ill haul the wagon for you why its not
as light as it might be got bricks in it or old metal 

 old metal said tom 

 i judged so the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool
away more time hunting up six bits worth of old iron to sell to the
foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work but
thats human nature hurry along hurry along 

the boys wanted to know what the hurry was about 

 never mind youll see when we get to the widow douglas 

huck said with some apprehension for he was long used to being
falsely accused 

 mr jones we havent been doing nothing 

the welshman laughed 

 well i dont know huck my boy i dont know about that aint you
and the widow good friends 

 yes well shes ben good friends to me anyway 

 all right then what do you want to be afraid for 

this question was not entirely answered in hucks slow mind before he
found himself pushed along with tom into mrs douglas drawing room 
mr jones left the wagon near the door and followed 

the place was grandly lighted and everybody that was of any
consequence in the village was there the thatchers were there the
harpers the rogerses aunt polly sid mary the minister the editor 
and a great many more and all dressed in their best the widow
received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such
looking beings they were covered with clay and candle grease aunt
polly blushed crimson with humiliation and frowned and shook her head
at tom nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did however mr 
jones said 

 tom wasnt at home yet so i gave him up but i stumbled on him and
huck right at my door and so i just brought them along in a hurry 

 and you did just right said the widow come with me boys 

she took them to a bedchamber and said 

 now wash and dress yourselves here are two new suits of clothes
 shirts socks everything complete theyre hucks no no thanks 
huck mr jones bought one and i the other but theyll fit both of you 
get into them well wait come down when you are slicked up enough 

then she left 



chapter xxxiv

huck said tom we can slope if we can find a rope the window aint
high from the ground 

 shucks what do you want to slope for 

 well i aint used to that kind of a crowd i cant stand it i aint
going down there tom 

 oh bother it aint anything i dont mind it a bit ill take care
of you 

sid appeared 

 tom said he auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon 
mary got your sunday clothes ready and everybodys been fretting about
you say aint this grease and clay on your clothes 

 now mr siddy you jist tend to your own business whats all this
blow out about anyway 

 its one of the widows parties that shes always having this time
its for the welshman and his sons on account of that scrape they
helped her out of the other night and say i can tell you something 
if you want to know 

 well what 

 why old mr jones is going to try to spring something on the people
here to night but i overheard him tell auntie to day about it as a
secret but i reckon its not much of a secret now everybody knows
 the widow too for all she tries to let on she dont mr jones was
bound huck should be here couldnt get along with his grand secret
without huck you know 

 secret about what sid 

 about huck tracking the robbers to the widows i reckon mr jones
was going to make a grand time over his surprise but i bet you it will
drop pretty flat 

sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way 

 sid was it you that told 

 oh never mind who it was somebody told thats enough 

 sid theres only one person in this town mean enough to do that and
thats you if you had been in hucks place youd a sneaked down the
hill and never told anybody on the robbers you cant do any but mean
things and you cant bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones 
there no thanks as the widow says and tom cuffed sids ears and
helped him to the door with several kicks now go and tell auntie if
you dare and to morrow youll catch it 

some minutes later the widows guests were at the supper table and a
dozen children were propped up at little side tables in the same room 
after the fashion of that country and that day at the proper time mr 
jones made his little speech in which he thanked the widow for the
honor she was doing himself and his sons but said that there was
another person whose modesty 

and so forth and so on he sprung his secret about hucks share in the
adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of but the
surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances however 
the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment and heaped so many
compliments and so much gratitude upon huck that he almost forgot the
nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely
intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybodys gaze
and everybodys laudations 

the widow said she meant to give huck a home under her roof and have
him educated and that when she could spare the money she would start
him in business in a modest way toms chance was come he said 

 huck dont need it hucks rich 

nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke but
the silence was a little awkward tom broke it 

 hucks got money maybe you dont believe it but hes got lots of
it oh you neednt smile i reckon i can show you you just wait a
minute 

tom ran out of doors the company looked at each other with a
perplexed interest and inquiringly at huck who was tongue tied 

 sid what ails tom said aunt polly he well there aint ever any
making of that boy out i never 

tom entered struggling with the weight of his sacks and aunt polly
did not finish her sentence tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon
the table and said 

 there what did i tell you half of its hucks and half of its mine 

the spectacle took the general breath away all gazed nobody spoke
for a moment then there was a unanimous call for an explanation tom
said he could furnish it and he did the tale was long but brimful of
interest there was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
charm of its flow when he had finished mr jones said 

 i thought i had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion but it
dont amount to anything now this one makes it sing mighty small im
willing to allow 

the money was counted the sum amounted to a little over twelve
thousand dollars it was more than any one present had ever seen at one
time before though several persons were there who were worth
considerably more than that in property 



chapter xxxv

the reader may rest satisfied that toms and hucks windfall made a
mighty stir in the poor little village of st petersburg so vast a
sum all in actual cash seemed next to incredible it was talked
about gloated over glorified until the reason of many of the
citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement every
 haunted house in st petersburg and the neighboring villages was
dissected plank by plank and its foundations dug up and ransacked for
hidden treasure and not by boys but men pretty grave unromantic
men too some of them wherever tom and huck appeared they were
courted admired stared at the boys were not able to remember that
their remarks had possessed weight before but now their sayings were
treasured and repeated everything they did seemed somehow to be
regarded as remarkable they had evidently lost the power of doing and
saying commonplace things moreover their past history was raked up
and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality the village
paper published biographical sketches of the boys 

the widow douglas put hucks money out at six per cent and judge
thatcher did the same with toms at aunt pollys request each lad had
an income now that was simply prodigious a dollar for every week day
in the year and half of the sundays it was just what the minister got
 no it was what he was promised he generally couldnt collect it a
dollar and a quarter a week would board lodge and school a boy in
those old simple days and clothe him and wash him too for that
matter 

judge thatcher had conceived a great opinion of tom he said that no
commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave when
becky told her father in strict confidence how tom had taken her
whipping at school the judge was visibly moved and when she pleaded
grace for the mighty lie which tom had told in order to shift that
whipping from her shoulders to his own the judge said with a fine
outburst that it was a noble a generous a magnanimous lie a lie that
was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to
breast with george washingtons lauded truth about the hatchet becky
thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he
walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that she went straight
off and told tom about it 

judge thatcher hoped to see tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
day he said he meant to look to it that tom should be admitted to the
national military academy and afterward trained in the best law school
in the country in order that he might be ready for either career or
both 

huck finns wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow
douglas protection introduced him into society no dragged him into
it hurled him into it and his sufferings were almost more than he
could bear the widows servants kept him clean and neat combed and
brushed and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had
not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know
for a friend he had to eat with a knife and fork he had to use
napkin cup and plate he had to learn his book he had to go to
church he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in
his mouth whithersoever he turned the bars and shackles of
civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot 

he bravely bore his miseries three weeks and then one day turned up
missing for forty eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in
great distress the public were profoundly concerned they searched
high and low they dragged the river for his body early the third
morning tom sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads
down behind the abandoned slaughter house and in one of them he found
the refugee huck had slept there he had just breakfasted upon some
stolen odds and ends of food and was lying off now in comfort with
his pipe he was unkempt uncombed and clad in the same old ruin of
rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and
happy tom routed him out told him the trouble he had been causing 
and urged him to go home hucks face lost its tranquil content and
took a melancholy cast he said 

 dont talk about it tom ive tried it and it dont work it dont
work tom it aint for me i aint used to it the widders good to
me and friendly but i cant stand them ways she makes me get up just
at the same time every morning she makes me wash they comb me all to

 huck i wouldnt want to and i dont want to but what would people

he said

pirating ill stick to the widder till i rot tom and if i git to be
a reglar ripper of a robber and everybody talking bout it i reckon
shell be proud she snaked me in out of the wet 



conclusion

so endeth this chronicle it being strictly a history of a boy it
must stop here the story could not go much further without becoming
the history of a man when one writes a novel about grown people he
knows exactly where to stop that is with a marriage but when he
writes of juveniles he must stop where he best can 

most of the characters that perform in this book still live and are
prosperous and happy some day it may seem worth while to take up the
story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they
turned out to be therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that
part of their lives at present

preface

the ungentle laws and customs touched upon in this tale are
historical and the episodes which are used to illustrate them
are also historical it is not pretended that these laws and
customs existed in england in the sixth century no it is only
pretended that inasmuch as they existed in the english and other
civilizations of far later times it is safe to consider that it is
no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have been in
practice in that day also one is quite justified in inferring
that whatever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that
remote time its place was competently filled by a worse one 

the question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right
of kings is not settled in this book it was found too difficult 
that the executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty
character and extraordinary ability was manifest and indisputable 
that none but the deity could select that head unerringly was
also manifest and indisputable that the deity ought to make that
selection then was likewise manifest and indisputable consequently 
that he does make it as claimed was an unavoidable deduction 
i mean until the author of this book encountered the pompadour 
and lady castlemaine and some other executive heads of that kind 
these were found so difficult to work into the scheme that it
was judged better to take the other tack in this book which
must be issued this fall and then go into training and settle
the question in another book it is of course a thing which
ought to be settled and i am not going to have anything particular
to do next winter anyway

a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court




a word of explanation

it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger
whom i am going to talk about he attracted me by three things 
his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor 
and the restfulness of his company for he did all the talking 
we fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd
that was being shown through and he at once began to say things
which interested me as he talked along softly pleasantly 
flowingly he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world
and time and into some remote era and old forgotten country 
and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that i seemed
to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray
antiquity holding speech with a relic of it exactly as i would
speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies or my most familiar
neighbors he spoke of sir bedivere sir bors de ganis sir launcelot
of the lake sir galahad and all the other great names of the
table round and how old old unspeakably old and faded and dry
and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on presently
he turned to me and said just as one might speak of the weather 
or any other common matter 

 you know about transmigration of souls do you know about
transposition of epochs and bodies 

i said i had not heard of it he was so little interested just
as when people speak of the weather that he did not notice
whether i made him any answer or not there was half a moment
of silence immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the
salaried cicerone 

 ancient hauberk date of the sixth century time of king arthur
and the round table said to have belonged to the knight sir sagramor
le desirous observe the round hole through the chain mail in
the left breast cant be accounted for supposed to have been
done with a bullet since invention of firearms perhaps maliciously
by cromwells soldiers 

my acquaintance smiled not a modern smile but one that must
have gone out of general use many many centuries ago and muttered
apparently to himself 

 wit ye well i saw it done then after a pause added 
 i did it myself 

by the time i had recovered from the electric surprise of this
remark he was gone 

all that evening i sat by my fire at the warwick arms steeped
in a dream of the olden time while the rain beat upon the windows 
and the wind roared about the eaves and corners from time to
time i dipped into old sir thomas malorys enchanting book and
fed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures breathed in
the fragrance of its obsolete names and dreamed again midnight
being come at length i read another tale for a nightcap this
which here follows to wit 

how sir launcelot slew two giants and made a castle free

 anon withal came there upon him two great giants 
 well armed all save the heads with two horrible
 clubs in their hands sir launcelot put his shield
 afore him and put the stroke away of the one
 giant and with his sword he clave his head asunder 
 when his fellow saw that he ran away as he were
 wood demented for fear of the horrible strokes 
 and sir launcelot after him with all his might 
 and smote him on the shoulder and clave him to
 the middle then sir launcelot went into the hall 
 and there came afore him three score ladies and
 damsels and all kneeled unto him and thanked
 god and him of their deliverance for sir said
 they the most part of us have been here this
 seven year their prisoners and we have worked all
 manner of silk works for our meat and we are all
 great gentle women born and blessed be the time 
 knight that ever thou wert born for thou hast
 done the most worship that ever did knight in the
 world that will we bear record and we all pray
 you to tell us your name that we may tell our
 friends who delivered us out of prison fair
 damsels he said my name is sir launcelot du
 lake and so he departed from them and betaught
 them unto god and then he mounted upon his
 horse and rode into many strange and wild
 countries and through many waters and valleys 
 and evil was he lodged and at the last by
 fortune him happened against a night to come to
 a fair courtilage and therein he found an old
 gentle woman that lodged him with a good will 
 and there he had good cheer for him and his horse 
 and when time was his host brought him into a
 fair garret over the gate to his bed there
 sir launcelot unarmed him and set his harness
 by him and went to bed and anon he fell on
 sleep so soon after there came one on
 horseback and knocked at the gate in great
 haste and when sir launcelot heard this he rose
 up and looked out at the window and saw by the
 moonlight three knights come riding after that
 one man and all three lashed on him at once
 with swords and that one knight turned on them
 knightly again and defended him truly said
 sir launcelot yonder one knight shall i help 
 for it were shame for me to see three knights
 on one and if he be slain i am partner of his
 death and therewith he took his harness and
 went out at a window by a sheet down to the four
 knights and then sir launcelot said on high 
 turn you knights unto me and leave your
 fighting with that knight and then they all
 three left sir kay and turned unto sir launcelot 
 and there began great battle for they alight
 all three and strake many strokes at sir
 launcelot and assailed him on every side then
 sir kay dressed him for to have holpen sir
 launcelot nay sir said he i will none of
 your help therefore as ye will have my help
 let me alone with them sir kay for the pleasure
 of the knight suffered him for to do his will 
 and so stood aside and then anon within six
 strokes sir launcelot had stricken them to the earth 

 and then they all three cried sir knight we
 yield us unto you as man of might matchless as
 to that said sir launcelot i will not take
 your yielding unto me but so that ye yield
 you unto sir kay the seneschal on that covenant
 i will save your lives and else not fair knight 
 said they that were we loath to do for as for
 sir kay we chased him hither and had overcome
 him had ye not been therefore to yield us unto
 him it were no reason well as to that said
 sir launcelot advise you well for ye may
 choose whether ye will die or live for an ye be
 yielden it shall be unto sir kay fair knight 
 then they said in saving our lives we will do
 as thou commandest us then shall ye said sir
 launcelot on whitsunday next coming go unto the
 court of king arthur and there shall ye yield
 you unto queen guenever and put you all three
 in her grace and mercy and say that sir kay
 sent you thither to be her prisoners on the morn
 sir launcelot arose early and left sir kay
 sleeping and sir launcelot took sir kays armor
 and his shield and armed him and so he went to
 the stable and took his horse and took his leave
 of his host and so he departed then soon after
 arose sir kay and missed sir launcelot and
 then he espied that he had his armor and his
 horse now by my faith i know well that he will
 grieve some of the court of king arthur for on
 him knights will be bold and deem that it is i 
 and that will beguile them and because of his
 armor and shield i am sure i shall ride in peace 
 and then soon after departed sir kay and
 thanked his host 


as i laid the book down there was a knock at the door and my
stranger came in i gave him a pipe and a chair and made him
welcome i also comforted him with a hot scotch whisky gave him
another one then still another hoping always for his story 
after a fourth persuader he drifted into it himself in a quite
simple and natural way 



the strangers history

i am an american i was born and reared in hartford in the state
of connecticut anyway just over the river in the country so
i am a yankee of the yankees and practical yes and nearly
barren of sentiment i suppose or poetry in other words my
father was a blacksmith my uncle was a horse doctor and i was
both along at first then i went over to the great arms factory
and learned my real trade learned all there was to it learned
to make everything guns revolvers cannon boilers engines all
sorts of labor saving machinery why i could make anything
a body wanted anything in the world it didnt make any difference
what and if there wasnt any quick new fangled way to make a thing 
i could invent one and do it as easy as rolling off a log i became
head superintendent had a couple of thousand men under me 

well a man like that is a man that is full of fight that goes
without saying with a couple of thousand rough men under one 
one has plenty of that sort of amusement i had anyway at last
i met my match and i got my dose it was during a misunderstanding
conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call hercules 
he laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made everything
crack and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it
overlap its neighbor then the world went out in darkness and
i didnt feel anything more and didnt know anything at all
 at least for a while 

when i came to again i was sitting under an oak tree on the
grass with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all
to myself nearly not entirely for there was a fellow on a horse 
looking down at me a fellow fresh out of a picture book he was
in old time iron armor from head to heel with a helmet on his
head the shape of a nail keg with slits in it and he had a shield 
and a sword and a prodigious spear and his horse had armor on 
too and a steel horn projecting from his forehead and gorgeous
red and green silk trappings that hung down all around him like
a bedquilt nearly to the ground 

 fair sir will ye just said this fellow 

 will i which 

 will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for 

 what are you giving me i said get along back to your circus 
or ill report you 

now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards
and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear with his
nail keg bent down nearly to his horses neck and his long spear
pointed straight ahead i saw he meant business so i was up
the tree when he arrived 

he allowed that i was his property the captive of his spear 
there was argument on his side and the bulk of the advantage
 so i judged it best to humor him we fixed up an agreement
whereby i was to go with him and he was not to hurt me i came
down and we started away i walking by the side of his horse 
we marched comfortably along through glades and over brooks which
i could not remember to have seen before which puzzled me and
made me wonder and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of
a circus so i gave up the idea of a circus and concluded he was
from an asylum but we never came to an asylum so i was up
a stump as you may say i asked him how far we were from hartford 
he said he had never heard of the place which i took to be a lie 
but allowed it to go at that at the end of an hour we saw a
far away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river and beyond
it on a hill a vast gray fortress with towers and turrets 
the first i had ever seen out of a picture 

 bridgeport said i pointing 

 camelot said he 


my stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness he caught
himself nodding now and smiled one of those pathetic obsolete
smiles of his and said 

 i find i cant go on but come with me ive got it all written
out and you can read it if you like 

in his chamber he said first i kept a journal then by and by 
after years i took the journal and turned it into a book how
long ago that was 

he handed me his manuscript and pointed out the place where
i should begin 

 begin here ive already told you what goes before he was
steeped in drowsiness by this time as i went out at his door
i heard him murmur sleepily give you good den fair sir 

i sat down by my fire and examined my treasure the first part
of it the great bulk of it was parchment and yellow with age 
i scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest 
under the old dim writing of the yankee historian appeared traces
of a penmanship which was older and dimmer still latin words
and sentences fragments from old monkish legends evidently 
i turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read
 as follows 




the tale of the lost land




chapter i

camelot

 camelot camelot said i to myself i dont seem to remember
hearing of it before name of the asylum likely 

it was a soft reposeful summer landscape as lovely as a dream 
and as lonesome as sunday the air was full of the smell of
flowers and the buzzing of insects and the twittering of birds 
and there were no people no wagons there was no stir of life 
nothing going on the road was mainly a winding path with hoof prints
in it and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in
the grass wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as ones hand 

presently a fair slip of a girl about ten years old with a cataract
of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders came along 
around her head she wore a hoop of flame red poppies it was as
sweet an outfit as ever i saw what there was of it she walked
indolently along with a mind at rest its peace reflected in her
innocent face the circus man paid no attention to her didnt
even seem to see her and she she was no more startled at his
fantastic make up than if she was used to his like every day of
her life she was going by as indifferently as she might have gone
by a couple of cows but when she happened to notice me then 
there was a change up went her hands and she was turned to stone 
her mouth dropped open her eyes stared wide and timorously she
was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear and
there she stood gazing in a sort of stupefied fascination till
we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view that
she should be startled at me instead of at the other man was too
many for me i couldnt make head or tail of it and that she
should seem to consider me a spectacle and totally overlook her
own merits in that respect was another puzzling thing and a
display of magnanimity too that was surprising in one so young 
there was food for thought here i moved along as one in a dream 

as we approached the town signs of life began to appear at
intervals we passed a wretched cabin with a thatched roof and
about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of
cultivation there were people too brawny men with long coarse 
uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look
like animals they and the women as a rule wore a coarse
tow linen robe that came well below the knee and a rude sort of
sandal and many wore an iron collar the small boys and girls
were always naked but nobody seemed to know it all of these
people stared at me talked about me ran into the huts and fetched
out their families to gape at me but nobody ever noticed that
other fellow except to make him humble salutation and get no
response for their pains 

in the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone
scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins the streets were
mere crooked alleys and unpaved troops of dogs and nude children
played in the sun and made life and noise hogs roamed and rooted
contentedly about and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in
the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family 
presently there was a distant blare of military music it came
nearer still nearer and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view 
glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners
and rich doublets and horse cloths and gilded spearheads and
through the muck and swine and naked brats and joyous dogs and
shabby huts it took its gallant way and in its wake we followed 
followed through one winding alley and then another and climbing 
always climbing till at last we gained the breezy height where
the huge castle stood there was an exchange of bugle blasts 
then a parley from the walls where men at arms in hauberk and
morion marched back and forth with halberd at shoulder under
flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon
them and then the great gates were flung open the drawbridge
was lowered and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under
the frowning arches and we following soon found ourselves in
a great paved court with towers and turrets stretching up into
the blue air on all the four sides and all about us the dismount
was going on and much greeting and ceremony and running to and
fro and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors and
an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion 



chapter ii

king arthurs court

the moment i got a chance i slipped aside privately and touched
an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said in an
insinuating confidential way 

 friend do me a kindness do you belong to the asylum or are
you just on a visit or something like that 

he looked me over stupidly and said 

 marry fair sir me seemeth 

 that will do i said i reckon you are a patient 

i moved away cogitating and at the same time keeping an eye
out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come
along and give me some light i judged i had found one presently 
so i drew him aside and said in his ear 

 if i could see the head keeper a minute only just a minute 

 prithee do not let me 

 let you what 

 hinder me then if the word please thee better then he went
on to say he was an under cook and could not stop to gossip 
though he would like it another time for it would comfort his
very liver to know where i got my clothes as he started away he
pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose 
and was seeking me besides no doubt this was an airy slim boy
in shrimp colored tights that made him look like a forked carrot 
the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles 
and he had long yellow curls and wore a plumed pink satin cap
tilted complacently over his ear by his look he was good natured 
by his gait he was satisfied with himself he was pretty enough
to frame he arrived looked me over with a smiling and impudent
curiosity said he had come for me and informed me that he was a page 

 go long i said you aint more than a paragraph 

it was pretty severe but i was nettled however it never phazed
him he didnt appear to know he was hurt he began to talk and
laugh in happy thoughtless boyish fashion as we walked along 
and made himself old friends with me at once asked me all sorts
of questions about myself and about my clothes but never waited
for an answer always chattered straight ahead as if he didnt
know he had asked a question and wasnt expecting any reply until
at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning
of the year 

it made the cold chills creep over me i stopped and said 
a little faintly 

 maybe i didnt hear you just right say it again and say it
slow what year was it 

 

 you dont look it come my boy i am a stranger and
friendless be honest and honorable with me are you in your
right mind 

he said he was 

 are these other people in their right minds 

he said they were 

 and this isnt an asylum i mean it isnt a place where they
cure crazy people 

he said it wasnt 

 well then i said either i am a lunatic or something just
as awful has happened now tell me honest and true where am i 

 in king arthurs court 

i waited a minute to let that idea shudder its way home 
and then said 

 and according to your notions what year is it now 

 nineteenth of june 

i felt a mournful sinking at the heart and muttered i shall
never see my friends again never never again they will not
be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet 

i seemed to believe the boy i didnt know why something in me
seemed to believe him my consciousness as you may say but my
reason didnt my reason straightway began to clamor that was
natural i didnt know how to go about satisfying it because
i knew that the testimony of men wouldnt serve my reason would
say they were lunatics and throw out their evidence but all
of a sudden i stumbled on the very thing just by luck i knew
that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the
sixth century occurred on the st of june a d o s and
began at minutes after noon i also knew that no total eclipse
of the sun was due in what to me was the present year i e 
so if i could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart
out of me for forty eight hours i should then find out for certain
whether this boy was telling me the truth or not 

wherefore being a practical connecticut man i now shoved this
whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour
should come in order that i might turn all my attention to the
circumstances of the present moment and be alert and ready to
make the most out of them that could be made one thing at a time 
is my motto and just play that thing for all it is worth even
if its only two pair and a jack i made up my mind to two things 
if it was still the nineteenth century and i was among lunatics
and couldnt get away i would presently boss that asylum or know
the reason why and if on the other hand it was really the sixth
century all right i didnt want any softer thing i would boss
the whole country inside of three months for i judged i would
have the start of the best educated man in the kingdom by a matter
of thirteen hundred years and upward im not a man to waste
time after my minds made up and theres work on hand so i said
to the page 

 now clarence my boy if that might happen to be your name
 ill get you to post me up a little if you dont mind what is
the name of that apparition that brought me here 

 my master and thine that is the good knight and great lord
sir kay the seneschal foster brother to our liege the king 

 very good go on tell me everything 

he made a long story of it but the part that had immediate interest
for me was this he said i was sir kays prisoner and that
in the due course of custom i would be flung into a dungeon and
left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me unless
i chanced to rot first i saw that the last chance had the best
show but i didnt waste any bother about that time was too
precious the page said further that dinner was about ended
in the great hall by this time and that as soon as the sociability
and the heavy drinking should begin sir kay would have me in and
exhibit me before king arthur and his illustrious knights seated at
the table round and would brag about his exploit in capturing
me and would probably exaggerate the facts a little but it
wouldnt be good form for me to correct him and not over safe 
either and when i was done being exhibited then ho for the
dungeon but he clarence would find a way to come and see me every
now and then and cheer me up and help me get word to my friends 

get word to my friends i thanked him i couldnt do less and
about this time a lackey came to say i was wanted so clarence
led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me 

well it was a curious kind of spectacle and interesting it was
an immense place and rather naked yes and full of loud contrasts 
it was very very lofty so lofty that the banners depending from
the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of
twilight there was a stone railed gallery at each end high up 
with musicians in the one and women clothed in stunning colors 
in the other the floor was of big stone flags laid in black and
white squares rather battered by age and use and needing repair 
as to ornament there wasnt any strictly speaking though on
the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed
as works of art battle pieces they were with horses shaped like
those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread 
with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by
round holes so that the mans coat looks as if it had been done
with a biscuit punch there was a fireplace big enough to camp in 
and its projecting sides and hood of carved and pillared stonework 
had the look of a cathedral door along the walls stood men at arms 
in breastplate and morion with halberds for their only weapon
 rigid as statues and that is what they looked like 

in the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken
table which they called the table round it was as large as
a circus ring and around it sat a great company of men dressed
in such various and splendid colors that it hurt ones eyes to look
at them they wore their plumed hats right along except that
whenever one addressed himself directly to the king he lifted
his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark 

mainly they were drinking from entire ox horns but a few were
still munching bread or gnawing beef bones there was about
an average of two dogs to one man and these sat in expectant
attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them and then they went
for it by brigades and divisions with a rush and there ensued
a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of
plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails and the storm of
howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time but that
was no matter for the dog fight was always a bigger interest
anyway the men rose sometimes to observe it the better and bet
on it and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out
over their balusters with the same object and all broke into
delighted ejaculations from time to time in the end the winning
dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his
paws and proceeded to growl over it and gnaw it and grease
the floor with it just as fifty others were already doing and the
rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments 

as a rule the speech and behavior of these people were gracious
and courtly and i noticed that they were good and serious listeners
when anybody was telling anything i mean in a dog fightless
interval and plainly too they were a childlike and innocent lot 
telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and
winning naivety and ready and willing to listen to anybody elses
lie and believe it too it was hard to associate them with
anything cruel or dreadful and yet they dealt in tales of blood
and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget
to shudder 

i was not the only prisoner present there were twenty or more 
poor devils many of them were maimed hacked carved in a frightful
way and their hair their faces their clothing were caked with
black and stiffened drenchings of blood they were suffering
sharp physical pain of course and weariness and hunger and
thirst no doubt and at least none had given them the comfort
of a wash or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds 
yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan or saw them show
any sign of restlessness or any disposition to complain the
thought was forced upon me the rascals they have served other
people so in their day it being their own turn now they were
not expecting any better treatment than this so their philosophical
bearing is not an outcome of mental training intellectual fortitude 
reasoning it is mere animal training they are white indians 



chapter iii

knights of the table round

mainly the round table talk was monologues narrative accounts
of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their
friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor 
as a general thing as far as i could make out these murderous
adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries nor to
settle old disputes or sudden fallings out no as a rule they were
simply duels between strangers duels between people who had never
even been introduced to each other and between whom existed no
cause of offense whatever many a time i had seen a couple of boys 
strangers meet by chance and say simultaneously i can lick you 
and go at it on the spot but i had always imagined until now that
that sort of thing belonged to children only and was a sign and
mark of childhood but here were these big boobies sticking to it
and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond yet there
was something very engaging about these great simple hearted
creatures something attractive and lovable there did not seem
to be brains enough in the entire nursery so to speak to bait
a fish hook with but you didnt seem to mind that after a little 
because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society
like that and indeed would have marred it hindered it spoiled
its symmetry perhaps rendered its existence impossible 

there was a fine manliness observable in almost every face and
in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your
belittling criticisms and stilled them a most noble benignity
and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called sir galahad 
and likewise in the kings also and there was majesty and greatness
in the giant frame and high bearing of sir launcelot of the lake 

there was presently an incident which centered the general interest
upon this sir launcelot at a sign from a sort of master of
ceremonies six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward
in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward
the ladies gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen 
the most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower bed
of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent 
and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his
fellows into her hands for free pardon ransom captivity or death 
as she in her good pleasure might elect and this as he said he
was doing by command of sir kay the seneschal whose prisoners
they were he having vanquished them by his single might and
prowess in sturdy conflict in the field 

surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over
the house the queens gratified smile faded out at the name of
sir kay and she looked disappointed and the page whispered in
my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision 

 sir kay forsooth oh call me pet names dearest call me
a marine in twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention
of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie 

every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon sir kay but he
was equal to the occasion he got up and played his hand like
a major and took every trick he said he would state the case
exactly according to the facts he would tell the simple
straightforward tale without comment of his own and then 
said he if ye find glory and honor due ye will give it unto him
who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or
strake with sword in the ranks of christian battle even him that
sitteth there and he pointed to sir launcelot ah he fetched
them it was a rattling good stroke then he went on and told
how sir launcelot seeking adventures some brief time gone by 
killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword and set a hundred
and forty two captive maidens free and then went further still
seeking adventures and found him sir kay fighting a desperate
fight against nine foreign knights and straightway took the battle
solely into his own hands and conquered the nine and that night
sir launcelot rose quietly and dressed him in sir kays armor and
took sir kays horse and gat him away into distant lands and
vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty four
in another and all these and the former nine he made to swear
that about whitsuntide they would ride to arthurs court and yield
them to queen guenevers hands as captives of sir kay the seneschal 
spoil of his knightly prowess and now here were these half dozen 
and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of
their desperate wounds 

well it was touching to see the queen blush and smile and look
embarrassed and happy and fling furtive glances at sir launcelot
that would have got him shot in arkansas to a dead certainty 

everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot and
as for me i was perfectly amazed that one man all by himself 
should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions
of practiced fighters i said as much to clarence but this mocking
featherhead only said 

 an sir kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him 
ye had seen the accompt doubled 

i looked at the boy in sorrow and as i looked i saw the cloud of
a deep despondency settle upon his countenance i followed the
direction of his eye and saw that a very old and white bearded
man clothed in a flowing black gown had risen and was standing
at the table upon unsteady legs and feebly swaying his ancient
head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye 
the same suffering look that was in the pages face was observable
in all the faces around the look of dumb creatures who know that
they must endure and make no moan 

 marry we shall have it again sighed the boy that same old
weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words 
and that he will tell till he dieth every time he hath gotten his
barrel full and feeleth his exaggeration mill a working would
god i had died or i saw this day 

 who is it 

 merlin the mighty liar and magician perdition singe him for
the weariness he worketh with his one tale but that men fear
him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the
devils that be in hell at his beck and call they would have dug
his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and
squelch it he telleth it always in the third person making
believe he is too modest to glorify himself maledictions light
upon him misfortune be his dole good friend prithee call me
for evensong 

the boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go
to sleep the old man began his tale and presently the lad was
asleep in reality so also were the dogs and the court the lackeys 
and the files of men at arms the droning voice droned on a soft
snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued
accompaniment of wind instruments some heads were bowed upon
folded arms some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious
music the flies buzzed and bit unmolested the rats swarmed
softly out from a hundred holes and pattered about and made
themselves at home everywhere and one of them sat up like a
squirrel on the kings head and held a bit of cheese in its hands
and nibbled it and dribbled the crumbs in the kings face with
naive and impudent irreverence it was a tranquil scene and
restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit 

this was the old mans tale he said 

 right so the king and merlin departed and went until an hermit
that was a good man and a great leech so the hermit searched
all his wounds and gave him good salves so the king was there
three days and then were his wounds well amended that he might
ride and go and so departed and as they rode arthur said 
i have no sword no force footnote from m t no matter 
said merlin hereby is a sword that shall be yours and i may 
so they rode till they came to a lake the which was a fair water
and broad and in the midst of the lake arthur was ware of an arm
clothed in white samite that held a fair sword in that hand 
lo said merlin yonder is that sword that i spake of with that
they saw a damsel going upon the lake what damsel is that 
said arthur that is the lady of the lake said merlin and within
that lake is a rock and therein is as fair a place as any on earth 
and richly beseen and this damsel will come to you anon and then
speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword anon
withal came the damsel unto arthur and saluted him and he her
again damsel said arthur what sword is that that yonder
the arm holdeth above the water i would it were mine for i have
no sword sir arthur king said the damsel that sword is mine 
and if ye will give me a gift when i ask it you ye shall have it 
by my faith said arthur i will give you what gift ye will ask 
well said the damsel go ye into yonder barge and row yourself
to the sword and take it and the scabbard with you and i will ask
my gift when i see my time so sir arthur and merlin alight and
tied their horses to two trees and so they went into the ship 
and when they came to the sword that the hand held sir arthur
took it up by the handles and took it with him and the arm
and the hand went under the water and so they came unto the land
and rode forth and then sir arthur saw a rich pavilion what
signifieth yonder pavilion it is the knights pavilion said
merlin that ye fought with last sir pellinore but he is out 
he is not there he hath ado with a knight of yours that hight
egglame and they have fought together but at the last egglame
fled and else he had been dead and he hath chased him even
to carlion and we shall meet with him anon in the highway that
is well said said arthur now have i a sword now will i wage
battle with him and be avenged on him sir ye shall not so 
said merlin for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing so
that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him also he will
not lightly be matched of one knight living and therefore it is my
counsel let him pass for he shall do you good service in short
time and his sons after his days also ye shall see that day
in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister
to wed when i see him i will do as ye advise me said arthur 
then sir arthur looked on the sword and liked it passing well 
whether liketh you better said merlin the sword or the scabbard 
me liketh better the sword said arthur ye are more unwise 
said merlin for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword for while
ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood be ye
never so sore wounded therefore keep well the scabbard always
with you so they rode into carlion and by the way they met with
sir pellinore but merlin had done such a craft that pellinore saw
not arthur and he passed by without any words i marvel said
arthur that the knight would not speak sir said merlin he saw
you not for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed so
they came unto carlion whereof his knights were passing glad 
and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would
jeopard his person so alone but all men of worship said it was
merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in
adventure as other poor knights did 



chapter iv

sir dinadan the humorist

it seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully
told but then i had heard it only once and that makes a difference 
it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh no doubt 

sir dinadan the humorist was the first to awake and he soon roused
the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality 
he tied some metal mugs to a dogs tail and turned him loose 
and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright 
with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and
crashing against everything that came in their way and making
altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and
turmoil at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed
till the tears flowed and some fell out of their chairs and
wallowed on the floor in ecstasy it was just like so many children 
sir dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep
from telling over and over again to weariness how the immortal
idea happened to occur to him and as is the way with humorists
of his breed he was still laughing at it after everybody else had
got through he was so set up that he concluded to make a speech
 of course a humorous speech i think i never heard so many old
played out jokes strung together in my life he was worse than
the minstrels worse than the clown in the circus it seemed
peculiarly sad to sit here thirteen hundred years before i was
born and listen again to poor flat worm eaten jokes that had
given me the dry gripes when i was a boy thirteen hundred years
afterwards it about convinced me that there isnt any such thing
as a new joke possible everybody laughed at these antiquities
 but then they always do i had noticed that centuries later 
however of course the scoffer didnt laugh i mean the boy no 
he scoffed there wasnt anything he wouldnt scoff at he said
the most of sir dinadans jokes were rotten and the rest were
petrified i said petrified was good as i believed myself 
that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of
those jokes was by geologic periods but that neat idea hit
the boy in a blank place for geology hadnt been invented yet 
however i made a note of the remark and calculated to educate
the commonwealth up to it if i pulled through it is no use
to throw a good thing away merely because the market isnt ripe yet 

now sir kay arose and began to fire up on his history mill with me
for fuel it was time for me to feel serious and i did sir kay
told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians who
all wore the same ridiculous garb that i did a garb that was a work
of enchantment and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt
by human hands however he had nullified the force of the
enchantment by prayer and had killed my thirteen knights in
a three hours battle and taken me prisoner sparing my life
in order that so strange a curiosity as i was might be exhibited
to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court he spoke
of me all the time in the blandest way as this prodigious giant 
and this horrible sky towering monster and this tusked and
taloned man devouring ogre and everybody took in all this bosh
in the naivest way and never smiled or seemed to notice that
there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me 
he said that in trying to escape from him i sprang into the top of
a tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound but he dislodged
me with a stone the size of a cow which all to brast the most
of my bones and then swore me to appear at arthurs court for
sentence he ended by condemning me to die at noon on the st 
and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before
he named the date 

i was in a dismal state by this time indeed i was hardly enough
in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as
to how i had better be killed the possibility of the killing being
doubted by some because of the enchantment in my clothes and yet
it was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen dollar slop shops 
still i was sane enough to notice this detail to wit many of
the terms used in the most matter of fact way by this great
assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would
have made a comanche blush indelicacy is too mild a term to convey
the idea however i had read tom jones and roderick random 
and other books of that kind and knew that the highest and first
ladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleaner
in their talk and in the morals and conduct which such talk
implies clear up to a hundred years ago in fact clear into our
own nineteenth century in which century broadly speaking 
the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable
in english history or in european history for that matter may be
said to have made their appearance suppose sir walter instead
of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters 
had allowed the characters to speak for themselves we should
have had talk from rebecca and ivanhoe and the soft lady rowena
which would embarrass a tramp in our day however to the
unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate king arthurs
people were not aware that they were indecent and i had presence
of mind enough not to mention it 

they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were
mightily relieved at last when old merlin swept the difficulty
away for them with a common sense hint he asked them why they
were so dull why didnt it occur to them to strip me in half a
minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs and dear dear to think
of it i was the only embarrassed person there everybody discussed
me and did it as unconcernedly as if i had been a cabbage 
queen guenever was as naively interested as the rest and said
she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before it was
the only compliment i got if it was a compliment 

finally i was carried off in one direction and my perilous clothes
in another i was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon 
with some scant remnants for dinner some moldy straw for a bed 
and no end of rats for company 



chapter v

an inspiration

i was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long 

when i next came to myself i seemed to have been asleep a very
long time my first thought was well what an astonishing dream
ive had i reckon ive waked only just in time to keep from
being hanged or drowned or burned or something ill nap again
till the whistle blows and then ill go down to the arms factory
and have it out with hercules 

but just then i heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts 
a light flashed in my eyes and that butterfly clarence stood
before me i gasped with surprise my breath almost got away from me 

 what i said you here yet go along with the rest of
the dream scatter 

but he only laughed in his light hearted way and fell to making
fun of my sorry plight 

 all right i said resignedly let the dream go on im in no hurry 

 prithee what dream 

 what dream why the dream that i am in arthurs court a person
who never existed and that i am talking to you who are nothing
but a work of the imagination 

 oh la indeed and is it a dream that youre to be burned
to morrow ho ho answer me that 

the shock that went through me was distressing i now began
to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious dream
or no dream for i knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity
of dreams that to be burned to death even in a dream would be
very far from being a jest and was a thing to be avoided by any
means fair or foul that i could contrive so i said beseechingly 

 ah clarence good boy only friend ive got for you are my
friend arent you dont fail me help me to devise some way
of escaping from this place 

 now do but hear thyself escape why man the corridors are
in guard and keep of men at arms 

 no doubt no doubt but how many clarence not many i hope 

 full a score one may not hope to escape after a pause
 hesitatingly and there be other reasons and weightier 

 other ones what are they 

 well they say oh but i darent indeed darent 

 why poor lad what is the matter why do you blench why do
you tremble so 

 oh in sooth there is need i do want to tell you but 

 come come be brave be a man speak out theres a good lad 

he hesitated pulled one way by desire the other way by fear 
then he stole to the door and peeped out listening and finally
crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his
fearful news in a whisper and with all the cowering apprehension
of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things
whose very mention might be freighted with death 

 merlin in his malice has woven a spell about this dungeon and
there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate
enough to essay to cross its lines with you now god pity me 
i have told it ah be kind to me be merciful to a poor boy who
means thee well for an thou betray me i am lost 

i laughed the only really refreshing laugh i had had for some time 
and shouted 

 merlin has wrought a spell merlin forsooth that cheap old
humbug that maundering old ass bosh pure bosh the silliest bosh
in the world why it does seem to me that of all the childish 
idiotic chuckle headed chicken livered superstitions that ev
 oh damn merlin 

but clarence had slumped to his knees before i had half finished 
and he was like to go out of his mind with fright 

 oh beware these are awful words any moment these walls
may crumble upon us if you say such things oh call them back
before it is too late 

now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to
thinking if everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely
afraid of merlins pretended magic as clarence was certainly
a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive
some way to take advantage of such a state of things i went
on thinking and worked out a plan then i said 

 get up pull yourself together look me in the eye do you
know why i laughed 

 no but for our blessed ladys sake do it no more 

 well ill tell you why i laughed because im a magician myself 

 thou the boy recoiled a step and caught his breath for
the thing hit him rather sudden but the aspect which he took
on was very very respectful i took quick note of that it
indicated that a humbug didnt need to have a reputation in this
asylum people stood ready to take him at his word without that 
i resumed 

 ive known merlin seven hundred years and he 

 seven hun 

 dont interrupt me he has died and come alive again thirteen
times and traveled under a new name every time smith jones 
robinson jackson peters haskins merlin a new alias every
time he turns up i knew him in egypt three hundred years ago 
i knew him in india five hundred years ago he is always blethering
around in my way everywhere i go he makes me tired he dont
amount to shucks as a magician knows some of the old common
tricks but has never got beyond the rudiments and never will 
he is well enough for the provinces one night stands and that
sort of thing you know but dear me he oughtnt to set up for
an expert anyway not where theres a real artist now look here 
clarence i am going to stand your friend right along and in
return you must be mine i want you to do me a favor i want
you to get word to the king that i am a magician myself and the
supreme grand high yu muck amuck and head of the tribe at that 
and i want him to be made to understand that i am just quietly
arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these
realms if sir kays project is carried out and any harm comes
to me will you get that to the king for me 

the poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me 
it was pitiful to see a creature so terrified so unnerved so
demoralized but he promised everything and on my side he made
me promise over and over again that i would remain his friend and
never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him then
he worked his way out staying himself with his hand along the
wall like a sick person 

presently this thought occurred to me how heedless i have been 
when the boy gets calm he will wonder why a great magician like me
should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place 
he will put this and that together and will see that i am a humbug 

i worried over that heedless blunder for an hour and called myself
a great many hard names meantime but finally it occurred to me
all of a sudden that these animals didnt reason that they never
put this and that together that all their talk showed that they
didnt know a discrepancy when they saw it i was at rest then 

but as soon as one is at rest in this world off he goes on
something else to worry about it occurred to me that i had made
another blunder i had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with
a threat i intending to invent a calamity at my leisure now
the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to
swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you
perform them suppose i should be called on for a sample suppose
i should be asked to name my calamity yes i had made a blunder 
i ought to have invented my calamity first what shall i do 
what can i say to gain a little time i was in trouble again 
in the deepest kind of trouble 

 theres a footstep theyre coming if i had only just a moment
to think good ive got it im all right 

you see it was the eclipse it came into my mind in the nick
of time how columbus or cortez or one of those people played
an eclipse as a saving trump once on some savages and i saw my
chance i could play it myself now and it wouldnt be any
plagiarism either because i should get it in nearly a thousand
years ahead of those parties 

clarence came in subdued distressed and said 

 i hasted the message to our liege the king and straightway he
had me to his presence he was frighted even to the marrow 
and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement and
that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so
great but then came merlin and spoiled all for he persuaded
the king that you are mad and know not whereof you speak and
said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing they
disputed long but in the end merlin scoffing said wherefore
hath he not named his brave calamity verily it is because he
cannot this thrust did in a most sudden sort close the kings
mouth and he could offer naught to turn the argument and so 
reluctant and full loth to do you the discourtesy he yet prayeth
you to consider his perplexed case as noting how the matter stands 
and name the calamity if so be you have determined the nature
of it and the time of its coming oh prithee delay not to delay
at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already
compass thee about oh be thou wise name the calamity 

i allowed silence to accumulate while i got my impressiveness
together and then said 

 how long have i been shut up in this hole 

 ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent it is of
the morning now 

 no then i have slept well sure enough nine in the morning
now and yet it is the very complexion of midnight to a shade 
this is the th then 

 the th yes 

 and i am to be burned alive to morrow the boy shuddered 

 at what hour 

 at high noon 

 now then i will tell you what to say i paused and stood over
that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence then in a voice
deep measured charged with doom i began and rose by dramatically
graded stages to my colossal climax which i delivered in as sublime
and noble a way as ever i did such a thing in my life go back
and tell the king that at that hour i will smother the whole world
in the dead blackness of midnight i will blot out the sun and he
shall never shine again the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack
of light and warmth and the peoples of the earth shall famish
and die to the last man 

i had to carry the boy out myself he sunk into such a collapse 
i handed him over to the soldiers and went back 



chapter vi

the eclipse

in the stillness and the darkness realization soon began to
supplement knowledge the mere knowledge of a fact is pale but
when you come to realize your fact it takes on color it is
all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to
the heart and seeing it done in the stillness and the darkness 
the knowledge that i was in deadly danger took to itself deeper
and deeper meaning all the time a something which was realization
crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold 

but it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these 
as soon as a mans mercury has got down to a certain point there
comes a revulsion and he rallies hope springs up and cheerfulness
along with it and then he is in good shape to do something for
himself if anything can be done when my rally came it came with
a bound i said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me 
and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides and straightway
my mercury went up to the top of the tube and my solicitudes
all vanished i was as happy a man as there was in the world 
i was even impatient for to morrow to come i so wanted to gather
in that great triumph and be the center of all the nations wonder
and reverence besides in a business way it would be the making
of me i knew that 

meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background
of my mind that was the half conviction that when the nature
of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious
people it would have such an effect that they would want to
compromise so by and by when i heard footsteps coming that
thought was recalled to me and i said to myself as sure as
anything its the compromise well if it is good all right 
i will accept but if it isnt i mean to stand my ground and play
my hand for all it is worth 

the door opened and some men at arms appeared the leader said 

 the stake is ready come 

the stake the strength went out of me and i almost fell down 
it is hard to get ones breath at such a time such lumps come into
ones throat and such gaspings but as soon as i could speak i said 

 but this is a mistake the execution is to morrow 

 order changed been set forward a day haste thee 

i was lost there was no help for me i was dazed stupefied 
i had no command over myself i only wandered purposely about 
like one out of his mind so the soldiers took hold of me and
pulled me along with them out of the cell and along the maze of
underground corridors and finally into the fierce glare of daylight
and the upper world as we stepped into the vast enclosed court
of the castle i got a shock for the first thing i saw was the stake 
standing in the center and near it the piled fagots and a monk 
on all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank
above rank forming sloping terraces that were rich with color 
the king and the queen sat in their thrones the most conspicuous
figures there of course 

to note all this occupied but a second the next second clarence
had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news
into my ear his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness he said 

 tis through me the change was wrought and main hard have i worked
to do it too but when i revealed to them the calamity in store 
and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender then saw i also
that this was the time to strike wherefore i diligently pretended 
unto this and that and the other one that your power against the sun
could not reach its full until the morrow and so if any would save
the sun and the world you must be slain to day while your
enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency odsbodikins 
it was but a dull lie a most indifferent invention but you should
have seen them seize it and swallow it in the frenzy of their
fright as it were salvation sent from heaven and all the while
was i laughing in my sleeve the one moment to see them so cheaply
deceived and glorifying god the next that he was content to let
the meanest of his creatures be his instrument to the saving of
thy life ah how happy has the matter sped you will not need
to do the sun a real hurt ah forget not that on your soul forget
it not only make a little darkness only the littlest little
darkness mind and cease with that it will be sufficient they
will see that i spoke falsely being ignorant as they will fancy
 and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you
shall see them go mad with fear and they will set you free and
make you great go to thy triumph now but remember ah good
friend i implore thee remember my supplication and do the blessed
sun no hurt for my sake thy true friend 

i choked out some words through my grief and misery as much as
to say i would spare the sun for which the lads eyes paid me back
with such deep and loving gratitude that i had not the heart
to tell him his good hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me
to my death 

as the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was
so profound that if i had been blindfold i should have supposed
i was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people 
there was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity 
they were as rigid as stone images and as pale and dread sat
upon every countenance this hush continued while i was being
chained to the stake it still continued while the fagots were
carefully and tediously piled about my ankles my knees my thighs 
my body then there was a pause and a deeper hush if possible 
and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch the multitude
strained forward gazing and parting slightly from their seats
without knowing it the monk raised his hands above my head and
his eyes toward the blue sky and began some words in latin in
this attitude he droned on and on a little while and then stopped 
i waited two or three moments then looked up he was standing
there petrified with a common impulse the multitude rose slowly
up and stared into the sky i followed their eyes as sure as guns 
there was my eclipse beginning the life went boiling through
my veins i was a new man the rim of black spread slowly into
the suns disk my heart beat higher and higher and still the
assemblage and the priest stared into the sky motionless i knew
that this gaze would be turned upon me next when it was i was
ready i was in one of the most grand attitudes i ever struck 
with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun it was a noble
effect you could see the shudder sweep the mass like a wave 
two shouts rang out one close upon the heels of the other 

 apply the torch 

 i forbid it 

the one was from merlin the other from the king merlin started
from his place to apply the torch himself i judged i said 

 stay where you are if any man moves even the king before
i give him leave i will blast him with thunder i will consume
him with lightnings 

the multitude sank meekly into their seats and i was just expecting
they would merlin hesitated a moment or two and i was on pins
and needles during that little while then he sat down and i took
a good breath for i knew i was master of the situation now 
the king said 

 be merciful fair sir and essay no further in this perilous matter 
lest disaster follow it was reported to us that your powers could
not attain unto their full strength until the morrow but 

 your majesty thinks the report may have been a lie it was a lie 

that made an immense effect up went appealing hands everywhere 
and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that
i might be bought off at any price and the calamity stayed 
the king was eager to comply he said 

 name any terms reverend sir even to the halving of my kingdom 
but banish this calamity spare the sun 

my fortune was made i would have taken him up in a minute but
i couldnt stop an eclipse the thing was out of the question so
i asked time to consider the king said 

 how long ah how long good sir be merciful look it groweth
darker moment by moment prithee how long 

 not long half an hour maybe an hour 

there were a thousand pathetic protests but i couldnt shorten up
any for i couldnt remember how long a total eclipse lasts i was
in a puzzled condition anyway and wanted to think something
was wrong about that eclipse and the fact was very unsettling 
if this wasnt the one i was after how was i to tell whether this
was the sixth century or nothing but a dream dear me if i could
only prove it was the latter here was a glad new hope if the boy
was right about the date and this was surely the th it wasnt 
the sixth century i reached for the monks sleeve in considerable
excitement and asked him what day of the month it was 

hang him he said it was the twenty first it made me turn cold
to hear him i begged him not to make any mistake about it but
he was sure he knew it was the st so that feather headed
boy had botched things again the time of the day was right
for the eclipse i had seen that for myself in the beginning 
by the dial that was near by yes i was in king arthurs court 
and i might as well make the most out of it i could 

the darkness was steadily growing the people becoming more and
more distressed i now said 

 i have reflected sir king for a lesson i will let this darkness
proceed and spread night in the world but whether i blot out
the sun for good or restore it shall rest with you these are
the terms to wit you shall remain king over all your dominions 
and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship 
but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive 
and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase
of revenue over and above its present amount as i may succeed
in creating for the state if i cant live on that i shant ask
anybody to give me a lift is it satisfactory 

there was a prodigious roar of applause and out of the midst
of it the kings voice rose saying 

 away with his bonds and set him free and do him homage high
and low rich and poor for he is become the kings right hand 
is clothed with power and authority and his seat is upon the highest
step of the throne now sweep away this creeping night and bring
the light and cheer again that all the world may bless thee 

but i said 

 that a common man should be shamed before the world is nothing 
but it were dishonor to the king if any that saw his minister naked
should not also see him delivered from his shame if i might ask
that my clothes be brought again 

 they are not meet the king broke in fetch raiment of another
sort clothe him like a prince 

my idea worked i wanted to keep things as they were till the
eclipse was total otherwise they would be trying again to get
me to dismiss the darkness and of course i couldnt do it sending
for the clothes gained some delay but not enough so i had to make
another excuse i said it would be but natural if the king should
change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done
under excitement therefore i would let the darkness grow a while 
and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind
the same the darkness should be dismissed neither the king nor
anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement but i had
to stick to my point 

it grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker while i struggled
with those awkward sixth century clothes it got to be pitch dark 
at last and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold
uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars
come out and twinkle in the sky at last the eclipse was total 
and i was very glad of it but everybody else was in misery which
was quite natural i said 

 the king by his silence still stands to the terms then
i lifted up my hands stood just so a moment then i said with
the most awful solemnity let the enchantment dissolve and
pass harmless away 

there was no response for a moment in that deep darkness and
that graveyard hush but when the silver rim of the sun pushed
itself out a moment or two later the assemblage broke loose with
a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me
with blessings and gratitude and clarence was not the last of
the wash to be sure 



chapter vii

merlins tower

inasmuch as i was now the second personage in the kingdom as far
as political power and authority were concerned much was made
of me my raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold 
and by consequence was very showy also uncomfortable but habit
would soon reconcile me to my clothes i was aware of that i was
given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle after
the kings they were aglow with loud colored silken hangings 
but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet 
and they were misfit rushes at that being not all of one breed 
as for conveniences properly speaking there werent any i mean
 little conveniences it is the little conveniences that make
the real comfort of life the big oaken chairs graced with rude
carvings were well enough but that was the stopping place 
there was no soap no matches no looking glass except a metal
one about as powerful as a pail of water and not a chromo 
i had been used to chromos for years and i saw now that without
my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric
of my being and was become a part of me it made me homesick
to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness
and remember that in our house in east hartford all unpretending
as it was you couldnt go into a room but you would find an
insurance chromo or at least a three color god bless our home
over the door and in the parlor we had nine but here even in
my grand room of state there wasnt anything in the nature of
a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt which was either
woven or knitted it had darned places in it and nothing in it
was the right color or the right shape and as for proportions 
even raphael himself couldnt have botched them more formidably 
after all his practice on those nightmares they call his celebrated
hampton court cartoons raphael was a bird we had several
of his chromos one was his miraculous draught of fishes where
he puts in a miracle of his own puts three men into a canoe which
wouldnt have held a dog without upsetting i always admired
to study r s art it was so fresh and unconventional 

there wasnt even a bell or a speaking tube in the castle i had
a great many servants and those that were on duty lolled in the
anteroom and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him 
there was no gas there were no candles a bronze dish half full
of boarding house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was
the thing that produced what was regarded as light a lot of
these hung along the walls and modified the dark just toned it
down enough to make it dismal if you went out at night your
servants carried torches there were no books pens paper or
ink and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows 
it is a little thing glass is until it is absent then it becomes
a big thing but perhaps the worst of all was that there wasnt
any sugar coffee tea or tobacco i saw that i was just another
robinson crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island with no society
but some more or less tame animals and if i wanted to make life
bearable i must do as he did invent contrive create reorganize
things set brain and hand to work and keep them busy well 
that was in my line 

one thing troubled me along at first the immense interest which
people took in me apparently the whole nation wanted a look
at me it soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the british
world almost to death that while it lasted the whole country 
from one end to the other was in a pitiable state of panic and
the churches hermitages and monkeries overflowed with praying
and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was
come then had followed the news that the producer of this awful
event was a stranger a mighty magician at arthurs court that he
could have blown out the sun like a candle and was just going
to do it when his mercy was purchased and he then dissolved
his enchantments and was now recognized and honored as the man
who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and
its peoples from extinction now if you consider that everybody
believed that and not only believed it but never even dreamed
of doubting it you will easily understand that there was not
a person in all britain that would not have walked fifty miles
to get a sight of me of course i was all the talk all other
subjects were dropped even the king became suddenly a person of
minor interest and notoriety within twenty four hours the
delegations began to arrive and from that time onward for a fortnight
they kept coming the village was crowded and all the countryside 
i had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these
reverent and awe stricken multitudes it came to be a great burden 
as to time and trouble but of course it was at the same time
compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center
of homage it turned brer merlin green with envy and spite which
was a great satisfaction to me but there was one thing i couldnt
understand nobody had asked for an autograph i spoke to clarence
about it by george i had to explain to him what it was then
he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen
priests land think of that 

there was another thing that troubled me a little those multitudes
presently began to agitate for another miracle that was natural 
to be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they
had seen the man who could command the sun riding in the heavens 
and be obeyed would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors 
and envied by them all but to be able to also say they had seen
him work a miracle themselves why people would come a distance
to see them the pressure got to be pretty strong there was
going to be an eclipse of the moon and i knew the date and hour 
but it was too far away two years i would have given a good
deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was
a big market for it it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so 
and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldnt have any
use for it as like as not if it had been booked for only a month
away i could have sold it short but as matters stood i couldnt
seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good so i gave up
trying next clarence found that old merlin was making himself
busy on the sly among those people he was spreading a report that
i was a humbug and that the reason i didnt accommodate the people
with a miracle was because i couldnt i saw that i must do
something i presently thought out a plan 

by my authority as executive i threw merlin into prison the same
cell i had occupied myself then i gave public notice by herald
and trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state for
a fortnight but about the end of that time i would take a moments
leisure and blow up merlins stone tower by fires from heaven 
in the meantime whoso listened to evil reports about me let him
beware furthermore i would perform but this one miracle at
this time and no more if it failed to satisfy and any murmured 
i would turn the murmurers into horses and make them useful 
quiet ensued 

i took clarence into my confidence to a certain degree and we
went to work privately i told him that this was a sort of miracle
that required a trifle of preparation and that it would be sudden
death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody that made
his mouth safe enough clandestinely we made a few bushels of
first rate blasting powder and i superintended my armorers while
they constructed a lightning rod and some wires this old stone
tower was very massive and rather ruinous too for it was roman 
and four hundred years old yes and handsome after a rude
fashion and clothed with ivy from base to summit as with a shirt
of scale mail it stood on a lonely eminence in good view from
the castle and about half a mile away 

working by night we stowed the powder in the tower dug stones
out on the inside and buried the powder in the walls themselves 
which were fifteen feet thick at the base we put in a peck
at a time in a dozen places we could have blown up the tower
of london with these charges when the thirteenth night was come
we put up our lightning rod bedded it in one of the batches of
powder and ran wires from it to the other batches everybody
had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation but
on the morning of the fourteenth i thought best to warn the people 
through the heralds to keep clear away a quarter of a mile away 
then added by command that at some time during the twenty four
hours i would consummate the miracle but would first give a brief
notice by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime by
torch baskets in the same places if at night 

thunder showers had been tolerably frequent of late and i was
not much afraid of a failure still i shouldnt have cared for
a delay of a day or two i should have explained that i was busy
with affairs of state yet and the people must wait 

of course we had a blazing sunny day almost the first one without
a cloud for three weeks things always happen so i kept secluded 
and watched the weather clarence dropped in from time to time
and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the
time and the whole country filling up with human masses as far
as one could see from the battlements at last the wind sprang up
and a cloud appeared in the right quarter too and just at
nightfall for a little while i watched that distant cloud spread
and blacken then i judged it was time for me to appear i ordered
the torch baskets to be lit and merlin liberated and sent to me 
a quarter of an hour later i ascended the parapet and there found
the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness
toward merlins tower already the darkness was so heavy that
one could not see far these people and the old turrets being
partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great
torch baskets overhead made a good deal of a picture 

merlin arrived in a gloomy mood i said 

 you wanted to burn me alive when i had not done you any harm 
and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional
reputation therefore i am going to call down fire and blow up
your tower but it is only fair to give you a chance now if you
think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires step
to the bat its your innings 

 i can fair sir and i will doubt it not 

he drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof and burnt
a pinch of powder in it which sent up a small cloud of aromatic
smoke whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves
and get uncomfortable then he began to mutter and make passes
in the air with his hands he worked himself up slowly and
gradually into a sort of frenzy and got to thrashing around with
his arms like the sails of a windmill by this time the storm had
about reached us the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and
making the shadows swash about the first heavy drops of rain
were falling the world abroad was black as pitch the lightning
began to wink fitfully of course my rod would be loading itself
now in fact things were imminent so i said 

 you have had time enough i have given you every advantage 
and not interfered it is plain your magic is weak it is only
fair that i begin now 

i made about three passes in the air and then there was an awful
crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks along
with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday 
and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground
in a general collapse of consternation well it rained mortar and
masonry the rest of the week this was the report but probably
the facts would have modified it 

it was an effective miracle the great bothersome temporary
population vanished there were a good many thousand tracks
in the mud the next morning but they were all outward bound 
if i had advertised another miracle i couldnt have raised an
audience with a sheriff 

merlins stock was flat the king wanted to stop his wages he
even wanted to banish him but i interfered i said he would be
useful to work the weather and attend to small matters like that 
and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor little
parlor magic soured on him there wasnt a rag of his tower left 
but i had the government rebuild it for him and advised him
to take boarders but he was too high toned for that and as for
being grateful he never even said thank you he was a rather
hard lot take him how you might but then you couldnt fairly
expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so 



chapter viii

the boss

to be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing but to have
the on looking world consent to it is a finer the tower episode
solidified my power and made it impregnable if any were perchance
disposed to be jealous and critical before that they experienced
a change of heart now there was not any one in the kingdom
who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters 

i was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances 
for a time i used to wake up mornings and smile at my dream 
and listen for the colts factory whistle but that sort of thing
played itself out gradually and at last i was fully able to realize
that i was actually living in the sixth century and in arthurs
court not a lunatic asylum after that i was just as much
at home in that century as i could have been in any other and
as for preference i wouldnt have traded it for the twentieth 
look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge brains 
pluck and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country 
the grandest field that ever was and all my own not a competitor 
not a man who wasnt a baby to me in acquirements and capacities 
whereas what would i amount to in the twentieth century i should
be foreman of a factory that is about all and could drag a seine
down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself 

what a jump i had made i couldnt keep from thinking about it 
and contemplating it just as one does who has struck oil there
was nothing back of me that could approach it unless it might be
josephs case and josephs only approached it it didnt equal
it quite for it stands to reason that as josephs splendid
financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king the general
public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor whereas
i had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun and was
popular by reason of it 

i was no shadow of a king i was the substance the king himself
was the shadow my power was colossal and it was not a mere
name as such things have generally been it was the genuine
article i stood here at the very spring and source of the second
great period of the worlds history and could see the trickling
stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden and roll
its mighty tides down the far centuries and i could note the
upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long
array of thrones de montforts gavestons mortimers villierses 
the war making campaign directing wantons of france and charles
the seconds scepter wielding drabs but nowhere in the procession
was my full sized fellow visible i was a unique and glad to know
that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen
centuries and a half for sure yes in power i was equal to
the king at the same time there was another power that was
a trifle stronger than both of us put together that was the church 
i do not wish to disguise that fact i couldnt if i wanted to 
but never mind about that now it will show up in its proper
place later on it didnt cause me any trouble in the beginning
 at least any of consequence 

well it was a curious country and full of interest and the
people they were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race 
why they were nothing but rabbits it was pitiful for a person
born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble
and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and church
and nobility as if they had any more occasion to love and honor
king and church and noble than a slave has to love and honor
the lash or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him 
why dear me any kind of royalty howsoever modified any kind
of aristocracy howsoever pruned is rightly an insult but if you
are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably
never find it out for yourself and dont believe it when somebody
else tells you it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race
to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones
without shadow of right or reason and the seventh rate people
that have always figured as its aristocracies a company of monarchs
and nobles who as a rule would have achieved only poverty and
obscurity if left like their betters to their own exertions 

the most of king arthurs british nation were slaves pure and
simple and bore that name and wore the iron collar on their
necks and the rest were slaves in fact but without the name 
they imagined themselves men and freemen and called themselves
so the truth was the nation as a body was in the world for one
object and one only to grovel before king and church and noble 
to slave for them sweat blood for them starve that they might
be fed work that they might play drink misery to the dregs that
they might be happy go naked that they might wear silks and
jewels pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them 
be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures
of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves
the gods of this world and for all this the thanks they got were
cuffs and contempt and so poor spirited were they that they took
even this sort of attention as an honor 

inherited ideas are a curious thing and interesting to observe
and examine i had mine the king and his people had theirs 
in both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit 
and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason
and argument would have had a long contract on his hands for
instance those people had inherited the idea that all men without
title and a long pedigree whether they had great natural gifts
and acquirements or hadnt were creatures of no more consideration
than so many animals bugs insects whereas i had inherited the idea
that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock shams
of inherited dignities and unearned titles are of no good but
to be laughed at the way i was looked upon was odd but it was
natural you know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant
in the menagerie well that is the idea they are full of
admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength they
speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels
which are far and away beyond their own powers and they speak
with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able
to drive a thousand men before him but does that make him one
of them no the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at
the idea he couldnt comprehend it couldnt take it in couldnt
in any remote way conceive of it well to the king the nobles 
and all the nation down to the very slaves and tramps i was
just that kind of an elephant and nothing more i was admired 
also feared but it was as an animal is admired and feared 
the animal is not reverenced neither was i i was not even
respected i had no pedigree no inherited title so in the kings
and nobles eyes i was mere dirt the people regarded me with
wonder and awe but there was no reverence mixed with it through
the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of
anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship 
there you see the hand of that awful power the roman catholic
church in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation
of men to a nation of worms before the day of the churchs
supremacy in the world men were men and held their heads up 
and had a mans pride and spirit and independence and what
of greatness and position a person got he got mainly by achievement 
not by birth but then the church came to the front with an axe
to grind and she was wise subtle and knew more than one way
to skin a cat or a nation she invented divine right of kings 
and propped it all around brick by brick with the beatitudes
 wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify
an evil one she preached to the commoner humility obedience
to superiors the beauty of self sacrifice she preached to the
commoner meekness under insult preached still to the commoner 
always to the commoner patience meanness of spirit non resistance
under oppression and she introduced heritable ranks and
aristocracies and taught all the christian populations of the earth
to bow down to them and worship them even down to my birth century
that poison was still in the blood of christendom and the best
of english commoners was still content to see his inferiors
impudently continuing to hold a number of positions such as
lordships and the throne to which the grotesque laws of his country
did not allow him to aspire in fact he was not merely contented
with this strange condition of things he was even able to persuade
himself that he was proud of it it seems to show that there isnt
anything you cant stand if you are only born and bred to it 
of course that taint that reverence for rank and title had been
in our american blood too i know that but when i left america
it had disappeared at least to all intents and purposes the
remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses when
a disease has worked its way down to that level it may fairly
be said to be out of the system 

but to return to my anomalous position in king arthurs kingdom 
here i was a giant among pigmies a man among children a master
intelligence among intellectual moles by all rational measurement
the one and only actually great man in that whole british world 
and yet there and then just as in the remote england of my
birth time the sheep witted earl who could claim long descent
from a kings leman acquired at second hand from the slums of
london was a better man than i was such a personage was fawned
upon in arthurs realm and reverently looked up to by everybody 
even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence 
and his morals as base as his lineage there were times when
 he could sit down in the kings presence but i couldnt i could
have got a title easily enough and that would have raised me
a large step in everybodys eyes even in the kings the giver
of it but i didnt ask for it and i declined it when it was
offered i couldnt have enjoyed such a thing with my notions 
and it wouldnt have been fair anyway because as far back as
i could go our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister 
i couldnt have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud
and set up over any title except one that should come from the nation
itself the only legitimate source and such an one i hoped to win 
and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor i did
win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride this title
fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith one day in a village 
was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth
with a laugh and an affirmative vote in ten days it had swept
the kingdom and was become as familiar as the kings name i was
never known by any other designation afterward whether in the
nations talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the
council board of the sovereign this title translated into modern
speech would be the boss elected by the nation that suited me 
and it was a pretty high title there were very few thes and
i was one of them if you spoke of the duke or the earl or
the bishop how could anybody tell which one you meant but if
you spoke of the king or the queen or the boss it was different 

well i liked the king and as king i respected him respected
the office at least respected it as much as i was capable of
respecting any unearned supremacy but as men i looked down upon
him and his nobles privately and he and they liked me and
respected my office but as an animal without birth or sham title 
they looked down upon me and were not particularly private about it 
either i didnt charge for my opinion about them and they didnt
charge for their opinion about me the account was square the
books balanced everybody was satisfied 



chapter ix

the tournament

they were always having grand tournaments there at camelot and
very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull fights
they were too but just a little wearisome to the practical mind 
however i was generally on hand for two reasons a man must
not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his
community have at heart if he would be liked especially as
a statesman and both as business man and statesman i wanted
to study the tournament and see if i couldnt invent an improvement
on it that reminds me to remark in passing that the very first
official thing i did in my administration and it was on the very
first day of it too was to start a patent office for i knew
that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was
just a crab and couldnt travel any way but sideways or backways 

things ran along a tournament nearly every week and now and then
the boys used to want me to take a hand i mean sir launcelot and
the rest but i said i would by and by no hurry yet and too much
government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a going 

we had one tournament which was continued from day to day during
more than a week and as many as five hundred knights took part
in it from first to last they were weeks gathering they came
on horseback from everywhere from the very ends of the country 
and even from beyond the sea and many brought ladies and all
brought squires and troops of servants it was a most gaudy and
gorgeous crowd as to costumery and very characteristic of the
country and the time in the way of high animal spirits innocent
indecencies of language and happy hearted indifference to morals 
it was fight or look on all day and every day and sing gamble 
dance carouse half the night every night they had a most noble
good time you never saw such people those banks of beautiful
ladies shining in their barbaric splendors would see a knight
sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness
of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting and instead
of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a
better view only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief 
and look ostentatiously broken hearted and then you could lay
two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was
afraid the public hadnt found it out 

the noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily but
i didnt mind it in the present circumstances because it kept me
from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the days
cripples they ruined an uncommon good old cross cut saw for me 
and broke the saw buck too but i let it pass and as for my
axe well i made up my mind that the next time i lent an axe
to a surgeon i would pick my century 

i not only watched this tournament from day to day but detailed
an intelligent priest from my department of public morals and
agriculture and ordered him to report it for it was my purpose
by and by when i should have gotten the people along far enough 
to start a newspaper the first thing you want in a new country 
is a patent office then work up your school system and after that 
out with your paper a newspaper has its faults and plenty of them 
but no matter its hark from the tomb for a dead nation and dont
you forget it you cant resurrect a dead nation without it there
isnt any way so i wanted to sample things and be finding out
what sort of reporter material i might be able to rake together out
of the sixth century when i should come to need it 

well the priest did very well considering he got in all
the details and that is a good thing in a local item you see 
he had kept books for the undertaker department of his church
when he was younger and there you know the moneys in the details 
the more details the more swag bearers mutes candles prayers
 everything counts and if the bereaved dont buy prayers enough
you mark up your candles with a forked pencil and your bill
shows up all right and he had a good knack at getting in the
complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely
to advertise no i mean a knight that had influence and he also
had a neat gift of exaggeration for in his time he had kept door
for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles 

of course this novices report lacked whoop and crash and lurid
description and therefore wanted the true ring but its antique
wording was quaint and sweet and simple and full of the fragrances
and flavors of the time and these little merits made up in a measure
for its more important lacks here is an extract from it 

 then sir brian de les isles and grummore grummorsum 
 knights of the castle encountered with sir aglovale and
 sir tor and sir tor smote down sir grummore grummorsum
 to the earth then came sir carados of the dolorous
 tower and sir turquine knights of the castle and
 there encountered with them sir percivale de galis
 and sir lamorak de galis that were two brethren and
 there encountered sir percivale with sir carados and
 either brake their spears unto their hands and then
 sir turquine with sir lamorak and either of them smote
 down other horse and all to the earth and either
 parties rescued other and horsed them again and sir
 arnold and sir gauter knights of the castle 
 encountered with sir brandiles and sir kay and these
 four knights encountered mightily and brake their
 spears to their hands then came sir pertolope from
 the castle and there encountered with him sir lionel 
 and there sir pertolope the green knight smote down sir
 lionel brother to sir launcelot all this was marked
 by noble heralds who bare him best and their names 
 then sir bleobaris brake his spear upon sir gareth 
 but of that stroke sir bleobaris fell to the earth 
 when sir galihodin saw that he bad sir gareth keep him 
 and sir gareth smote him to the earth then sir galihud
 gat a spear to avenge his brother and in the same wise
 sir gareth served him and sir dinadan and his brother
 la cote male taile and sir sagramore le disirous and
 sir dodinas le savage all these he bare down with one
 spear when king aswisance of ireland saw sir gareth
 fare so he marvelled what he might be that one time
 seemed green and another time at his again coming 
 he seemed blue and thus at every course that he rode
 to and fro he changed his color so that there might
 neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him 
 then sir agwisance the king of ireland encountered
 with sir gareth and there sir gareth smote him from
 his horse saddle and all and then came king carados
 of scotland and sir gareth smote him down horse and
 man and in the same wise he served king uriens of the
 land of gore and then there came in sir bagdemagus 
 and sir gareth smote him down horse and man to the
 earth and bagdemaguss son meliganus brake a spear
 upon sir gareth mightily and knightly and then sir
 galahault the noble prince cried on high knight with
 the many colors well hast thou justed now make thee
 ready that i may just with thee sir gareth heard him 
 and he gat a great spear and so they encountered
 together and there the prince brake his spear but sir
 gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm that
 he reeled here and there and he had fallen down had not
 his men recovered him truly said king arthur that
 knight with the many colors is a good knight wherefore
 the king called unto him sir launcelot and prayed him
 to encounter with that knight sir said launcelot i
 may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at
 this time for he hath had travail enough this day and
 when a good knight doth so well upon some day it is
 no good knights part to let him of his worship and 
 namely when he seeth a knight hath done so great
 labour for peradventure said sir launcelot his
 quarrel is here this day and peradventure he is best
 beloved with this lady of all that be here for i see
 well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great
 deeds and therefore said sir launcelot as for me 
 this day he shall have the honour though it lay in my
 power to put him from it i would not 

there was an unpleasant little episode that day which for reasons
of state i struck out of my priests report you will have noticed
that garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement when
i say garry i mean sir gareth garry was my private pet name
for him it suggests that i had a deep affection for him and that
was the case but it was a private pet name only and never spoken
aloud to any one much less to him being a noble he would not
have endured a familiarity like that from me well to proceed 
i sat in the private box set apart for me as the kings minister 
while sir dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists 
he came in there and sat down and began to talk for he was always
making up to me because i was a stranger and he liked to have
a fresh market for his jokes the most of them having reached that
stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while
the other person looks sick i had always responded to his efforts
as well as i could and felt a very deep and real kindness for him 
too for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one
particular anecdote which i had heard oftenest and had most hated
and most loathed all my life he had at least spared it me it was
one which i had heard attributed to every humorous person who
had ever stood on american soil from columbus down to artemus ward 
it was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience
with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh and
then when he was leaving some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully
by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever
heard and it was all they could do to keep from laughin right
out in meetin that anecdote never saw the day that it was
worth the telling and yet i had sat under the telling of it
hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times and
cried and cursed all the way through then who can hope to know
what my feelings were to hear this armor plated ass start in on
it again in the murky twilight of tradition before the dawn of
history while even lactantius might be referred to as the late
lactantius and the crusades wouldnt be born for five hundred
years yet just as he finished the call boy came so haw hawing
like a demon he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of
loose castings and i knew nothing more it was some minutes
before i came to and then i opened my eyes just in time to see
sir gareth fetch him an awful welt and i unconsciously out with
the prayer i hope to gracious hes killed but by ill luck 
before i had got half through with the words sir gareth crashed
into sir sagramor le desirous and sent him thundering over his
horses crupper and sir sagramor caught my remark and thought
i meant it for him 

well whenever one of those people got a thing into his head 
there was no getting it out again i knew that so i saved my
breath and offered no explanations as soon as sir sagramor
got well he notified me that there was a little account to settle
between us and he named a day three or four years in the future 
place of settlement the lists where the offense had been given 
i said i would be ready when he got back you see he was going
for the holy grail the boys all took a flier at the holy grail
now and then it was a several years cruise they always put in
the long absence snooping around in the most conscientious way 
though none of them had any idea where the holy grail really was 
and i dont think any of them actually expected to find it or
would have known what to do with it if he had run across it 
you see it was just the northwest passage of that day as you may
say that was all every year expeditions went out holy grailing 
and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for them there
was worlds of reputation in it but no money why they actually
wanted me to put in well i should smile 



chapter x

beginnings of civilization

the round table soon heard of the challenge and of course it was
a good deal discussed for such things interested the boys 
the king thought i ought now to set forth in quest of adventures 
so that i might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet
sir sagramor when the several years should have rolled away 
i excused myself for the present i said it would take me three
or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly 
then i should be ready all the chances were that at the end of
that time sir sagramor would still be out grailing so no valuable
time would be lost by the postponement i should then have been
in office six or seven years and i believed my system and machinery
would be so well developed that i could take a holiday without
its working any harm 

i was pretty well satisfied with what i had already accomplished 
in various quiet nooks and corners i had the beginnings of all
sorts of industries under way nuclei of future vast factories 
the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization in these
were gathered together the brightest young minds i could find 
and i kept agents out raking the country for more all the time 
i was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts experts
in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling these nurseries
of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their
obscure country retreats for nobody was allowed to come into their
precincts without a special permit for i was afraid of the church 

i had started a teacher factory and a lot of sunday schools the
first thing as a result i now had an admirable system of graded
schools in full blast in those places and also a complete variety
of protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing
condition everybody could be any kind of a christian he wanted
to there was perfect freedom in that matter but i confined public
religious teaching to the churches and the sunday schools permitting
nothing of it in my other educational buildings i could have
given my own sect the preference and made everybody a presbyterian
without any trouble but that would have been to affront a law
of human nature spiritual wants and instincts are as various in
the human family as are physical appetites complexions and
features and a man is only at his best morally when he is
equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and
size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion 
angularities and stature of the individual who wears it and 
besides i was afraid of a united church it makes a mighty power 
the mightiest conceivable and then when it by and by gets into
selfish hands as it is always bound to do it means death to
human liberty and paralysis to human thought 

all mines were royal property and there were a good many of them 
they had formerly been worked as savages always work mines holes
grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by
hand at the rate of a ton a day but i had begun to put the mining
on a scientific basis as early as i could 

yes i had made pretty handsome progress when sir sagramors
challenge struck me 

four years rolled by and then well you would never imagine
it in the world unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in
safe hands the despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect
government an earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect
earthly government if the conditions were the same namely the
despot the perfectest individual of the human race and his lease
of life perpetual but as a perishable perfect man must die and
leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor an
earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government it is
the worst form that is possible 

my works showed what a despot could do with the resources of
a kingdom at his command unsuspected by this dark land i had
the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very
nose it was fenced away from the public view but there it was 
a gigantic and unassailable fact and to be heard from yet if
i lived and had luck there it was as sure a fact and as substantial
a fact as any serene volcano standing innocent with its smokeless
summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its
bowels my schools and churches were children four years before 
they were grown up now my shops of that day were vast factories
now where i had a dozen trained men then i had a thousand now 
where i had one brilliant expert then i had fifty now i stood
with my hand on the cock so to speak ready to turn it on and
flood the midnight world with light at any moment but i was not
going to do the thing in that sudden way it was not my policy 
the people could not have stood it and moreover i should have
had the established roman catholic church on my back in a minute 

no i had been going cautiously all the while i had had confidential
agents trickling through the country some time whose office was
to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees and to gnaw
a little at this and that and the other superstition and so prepare
the way gradually for a better order of things i was turning on
my light one candle power at a time and meant to continue to do so 

i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom 
and they were doing very well i meant to work this racket more
and more as time wore on if nothing occurred to frighten me 
one of my deepest secrets was my west point my military academy 
i kept that most jealously out of sight and i did the same with my
naval academy which i had established at a remote seaport both
were prospering to my satisfaction 

clarence was twenty two now and was my head executive my right
hand he was a darling he was equal to anything there wasnt
anything he couldnt turn his hand to of late i had been training
him for journalism for the time seemed about right for a start
in the newspaper line nothing big but just a small weekly for
experimental circulation in my civilization nurseries he took
to it like a duck there was an editor concealed in him sure 
already he had doubled himself in one way he talked sixth century
and wrote nineteenth his journalistic style was climbing 
steadily it was already up to the back settlement alabama mark 
and couldnt be told from the editorial output of that region
either by matter or flavor 

we had another large departure on hand too this was a telegraph
and a telephone our first venture in this line these wires were
for private service only as yet and must be kept private until
a riper day should come we had a gang of men on the road working
mainly by night they were stringing ground wires we were afraid
to put up poles for they would attract too much inquiry ground
wires were good enough in both instances for my wires were
protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect 
my men had orders to strike across country avoiding roads and
establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights
betrayed their presence and leaving experts in charge nobody
could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom for nobody
ever went intentionally to any place but only struck it by
accident in his wanderings and then generally left it without
thinking to inquire what its name was at one time and another
we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the
kingdom but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble 
so we had given the thing up for the present it would be poor
wisdom to antagonize the church 

as for the general condition of the country it was as it had been
when i arrived in it to all intents and purposes i had made
changes but they were necessarily slight and they were not
noticeable thus far i had not even meddled with taxation 
outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues i had
systematized those and put the service on an effective and
righteous basis as a result these revenues were already quadrupled 
and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than
before that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief and the praises
of my administration were hearty and general 

personally i struck an interruption now but i did not mind it 
it could not have happened at a better time earlier it could
have annoyed me but now everything was in good hands and swimming
right along the king had reminded me several times of late that
the postponement i had asked for four years before had about
run out now it was a hint that i ought to be starting out to seek
adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy
of the honor of breaking a lance with sir sagramor who was still
out grailing but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions 
and might be found any year now so you see i was expecting
this interruption it did not take me by surprise 



chapter xi

the yankee in search of adventures

there never was such a country for wandering liars and they were
of both sexes hardly a month went by without one of these tramps
arriving and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or
other wanting help to get her out of some far away castle where
she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel usually a giant 
now you would think that the first thing the king would do after
listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger would be
to ask for credentials yes and a pointer or two as to locality
of castle best route to it and so on but nobody ever thought
of so simple and common sense a thing at that no everybody
swallowed these peoples lies whole and never asked a question
of any sort or about anything well one day when i was not
around one of these people came along it was a she one this
time and told a tale of the usual pattern her mistress was
a captive in a vast and gloomy castle along with forty four other
young and beautiful girls pretty much all of them princesses 
they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty six
years the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers 
each with four arms and one eye the eye in the center of the
forehead and as big as a fruit sort of fruit not mentioned 
their usual slovenliness in statistics 

would you believe it the king and the whole round table were
in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure 
every knight of the table jumped for the chance and begged for it 
but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me 
who had not asked for it at all 

by an effort i contained my joy when clarence brought me the news 
but he he could not contain his his mouth gushed delight and
gratitude in a steady discharge delight in my good fortune 
gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me 
he could keep neither his legs nor his body still but pirouetted
about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness 

on my side i could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon
me this benefaction but i kept my vexation under the surface
for policys sake and did what i could to let on to be glad 
indeed i said i was glad and in a way it was true i was as
glad as a person is when he is scalped 

well one must make the best of things and not waste time with
useless fretting but get down to business and see what can be
done in all lies there is wheat among the chaff i must get at
the wheat in this case so i sent for the girl and she came she
was a comely enough creature and soft and modest but if signs
went for anything she didnt know as much as a ladys watch i said 

 my dear have you been questioned as to particulars 

she said she hadnt 

 well i didnt expect you had but i thought i would ask to make
sure its the way ive been raised now you mustnt take it
unkindly if i remind you that as we dont know you we must go
a little slow you may be all right of course and well hope
that you are but to take it for granted isnt business you 
understand that im obliged to ask you a few questions just
answer up fair and square and dont be afraid where do you
live when you are at home 

 in the land of moder fair sir 

 land of moder i dont remember hearing of it before 
parents living 

 as to that i know not if they be yet on live sith it is many
years that i have lain shut up in the castle 

 your name please 

 i hight the demoiselle alisande la carteloise an it please you 

 do you know anybody here who can identify you 

 that were not likely fair lord i being come hither now for
the first time 

 have you brought any letters any documents any proofs that
you are trustworthy and truthful 

 of a surety no and wherefore should i have i not a tongue 
and cannot i say all that myself 

 but your saying it you know and somebody elses saying it 
is different 

 different how might that be i fear me i do not understand 

 dont understand land of why you see you see why great scott 
cant you understand a little thing like that cant you understand
the difference between your why do you look so innocent and idiotic 

 i in truth i know not but an it were the will of god 

 yes yes i reckon thats about the size of it dont mind my
seeming excited im not let us change the subject now as
to this castle with forty five princesses in it and three ogres
at the head of it tell me where is this harem 

 harem 

 the castle you understand where is the castle 

 oh as to that it is great and strong and well beseen and
lieth in a far country yes it is many leagues 

 how many 

 ah fair sir it were woundily hard to tell they are so many 
and do so lap the one upon the other and being made all in the
same image and tincted with the same color one may not know
the one league from its fellow nor how to count them except
they be taken apart and ye wit well it were gods work to do
that being not within mans capacity for ye will note 

 hold on hold on never mind about the distance whereabouts 
does the castle lie whats the direction from here 

 ah please you sir it hath no direction from here by reason
that the road lieth not straight but turneth evermore wherefore
the direction of its place abideth not but is some time under
the one sky and anon under another whereso if ye be minded that
it is in the east and wend thitherward ye shall observe that
the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space
of half a circle and this marvel happing again and yet again and
still again it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities
of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of him that
giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth
him and if it please him not will the rather that even all castles
and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth leaving the
places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant so warning his
creatures that where he will he will and where he will not he 

 oh thats all right thats all right give us a rest never mind
about the direction hang the direction i beg pardon i beg
a thousand pardons i am not well to day pay no attention when
i soliloquize it is an old habit an old bad habit and hard
to get rid of when ones digestion is all disordered with eating
food that was raised forever and ever before he was born good
land a man cant keep his functions regular on spring chickens
thirteen hundred years old but come never mind about that 
lets have you got such a thing as a map of that region about
you now a good map 

 is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers
have brought from over the great seas which being boiled in oil 
and an onion and salt added thereto doth 

 what a map what are you talking about dont you know what
a map is there there never mind dont explain i hate
explanations they fog a thing up so that you cant tell anything
about it run along dear good day show her the way clarence 

oh well it was reasonably plain now why these donkeys didnt
prospect these liars for details it may be that this girl had
a fact in her somewhere but i dont believe you could have sluiced
it out with a hydraulic nor got it with the earlier forms of
blasting even it was a case for dynamite why she was a perfect
ass and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if
she had been a leaf out of the gospel it kind of sizes up the
whole party and think of the simple ways of this court this
wandering wench hadnt any more trouble to get access to the king
in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse
in my day and country in fact he was glad to see her glad
to hear her tale with that adventure of hers to offer she was
as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner 

just as i was ending up these reflections clarence came back 
i remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl 
hadnt got hold of a single point that could help me to find
the castle the youth looked a little surprised or puzzled 
or something and intimated that he had been wondering to himself
what i had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for 

 why great guns i said dont i want to find the castle and
how else would i go about it 

 la sweet your worship one may lightly answer that i ween 
she will go with thee they always do she will ride with thee 

 ride with me nonsense 

 but of a truth she will she will ride with thee thou shalt see 

 what she browse around the hills and scour the woods with me
 alone and i as good as engaged to be married why its scandalous 
think how it would look 

my the dear face that rose before me the boy was eager to know
all about this tender matter i swore him to secrecy and then
whispered her name puss flanagan he looked disappointed 
and said he didnt remember the countess how natural it was for
the little courtier to give her a rank he asked me where she lived 

 in east har i came to myself and stopped a little confused 
then i said never mind now ill tell you some time 

and might he see her would i let him see her some day 

it was but a little thing to promise thirteen hundred years
or so and he so eager so i said yes but i sighed i couldnt
help it and yet there was no sense in sighing for she wasnt
born yet but that is the way we are made we dont reason 
where we feel we just feel 

my expedition was all the talk that day and that night and the
boys were very good to me and made much of me and seemed to have
forgotten their vexation and disappointment and come to be as
anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins
loose as if it were themselves that had the contract well they
 were good children but just children that is all and they
gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants and how
to scoop them in and they told me all sorts of charms against
enchantments and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my
wounds but it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if
i was such a wonderful necromancer as i was pretending to be 
i ought not to need salves or instructions or charms against
enchantments and least of all arms and armor on a foray of any
kind even against fire spouting dragons and devils hot from
perdition let alone such poor adversaries as these i was after 
these commonplace ogres of the back settlements 

i was to have an early breakfast and start at dawn for that was
the usual way but i had the demons own time with my armor 
and this delayed me a little it is troublesome to get into and
there is so much detail first you wrap a layer or two of blanket
around your body for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold
iron then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail these
are made of small steel links woven together and they form a fabric
so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor it slumps
into a pile like a peck of wet fish net it is very heavy and
is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night
shirt yet plenty used it for that tax collectors and reformers 
and one horse kings with a defective title and those sorts of
people then you put on your shoes flat boats roofed over with
interleaving bands of steel and screw your clumsy spurs into
the heels next you buckle your greaves on your legs and your
cuisses on your thighs then come your backplate and your breastplate 
and you begin to feel crowded then you hitch onto the breastplate
the half petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs
down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down 
and isnt any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle either
for looks or for wear or to wipe your hands on next you belt
on your sword then you put your stove pipe joints onto your arms 
your iron gauntlets onto your hands your iron rat trap onto your
head with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back
of your neck and there you are snug as a candle in a candle mould 
this is no time to dance well a man that is packed away like
that is a nut that isnt worth the cracking there is so little of
the meat when you get down to it by comparison with the shell 

the boys helped me or i never could have got in just as we
finished sir bedivere happened in and i saw that as like as not
i hadnt chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip how
stately he looked and tall and broad and grand he had on his
head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears and
for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his
upper lip and protected his nose and all the rest of him from
neck to heel was flexible chain mail trousers and all but
pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment which
of course was of chain mail as i said and hung straight from his
shoulders to his ankles and from his middle to the bottom both
before and behind was divided so that he could ride and let the
skirts hang down on each side he was going grailing and it was
just the outfit for it too i would have given a good deal for
that ulster but it was too late now to be fooling around the sun
was just up the king and the court were all on hand to see me off
and wish me luck so it wouldnt be etiquette for me to tarry 
you dont get on your horse yourself no if you tried it you
would get disappointed they carry you out just as they carry
a sun struck man to the drug store and put you on and help get
you to rights and fix your feet in the stirrups and all the while
you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else like
somebody that has been married on a sudden or struck by lightning 
or something like that and hasnt quite fetched around yet and
is sort of numb and cant just get his bearings then they
stood up the mast they called a spear in its socket by my left
foot and i gripped it with my hand lastly they hung my shield
around my neck and i was all complete and ready to up anchor
and get to sea everybody was as good to me as they could be 
and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup cup her own self there was
nothing more to do now but for that damsel to get up behind me on
a pillion which she did and put an arm or so around me to hold on 

and so we started and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their
handkerchiefs or helmets and everybody we met going down the hill
and through the village was respectful to us except some shabby
little boys on the outskirts they said 

 oh what a guy and hove clods at us 

in my experience boys are the same in all ages they dont respect
anything they dont care for anything or anybody they say
 go up baldhead to the prophet going his unoffending way in
the gray of antiquity they sass me in the holy gloom of the
middle ages and i had seen them act the same way in buchanans
administration i remember because i was there and helped the
prophet had his bears and settled with his boys and i wanted
to get down and settle with mine but it wouldnt answer because
i couldnt have got up again i hate a country without a derrick 



chapter xii

slow torture

straight off we were in the country it was most lovely and
pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning
in the first freshness of autumn from hilltops we saw fair
green valleys lying spread out below with streams winding through
them and island groves of trees here and there and huge lonely
oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade and beyond
the valleys we saw the ranges of hills blue with haze stretching
away in billowy perspective to the horizon with at wide intervals
a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave summit which we knew was
a castle we crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew 
and we moved like spirits the cushioned turf giving out no sound
of footfall we dreamed along through glades in a mist of green
light that got its tint from the sun drenched roof of leaves
overhead and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets
went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of
whispering music comfortable to hear and at times we left the
world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich
gloom of the forest where furtive wild things whisked and scurried
by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place
where the noise was and where only the earliest birds were turning
out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder
and a mysterious far off hammering and drumming for worms on
a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of
the woods and by and by out we would swing again into the glare 

about the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into
the glare it was along there somewhere a couple of hours or so
after sun up it wasnt as pleasant as it had been it was
beginning to get hot this was quite noticeable we had a very
long pull after that without any shade now it is curious how
progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get
a start things which i didnt mind at all at first i began
to mind now and more and more too all the time the first
ten or fifteen times i wanted my handkerchief i didnt seem to care 
i got along and said never mind it isnt any matter and dropped
it out of my mind but now it was different i wanted it all
the time it was nag nag nag right along and no rest i couldnt
get it out of my mind and so at last i lost my temper and said
hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets
in it you see i had my handkerchief in my helmet and some other
things but it was that kind of a helmet that you cant take off
by yourself that hadnt occurred to me when i put it there 
and in fact i didnt know it i supposed it would be particularly
convenient there and so now the thought of its being there 
so handy and close by and yet not get at able made it all the
worse and the harder to bear yes the thing that you cant get
is the thing that you want mainly every one has noticed that 
well it took my mind off from everything else took it clear off 
and centered it in my helmet and mile after mile there it stayed 
imagining the handkerchief picturing the handkerchief and it
was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling
down into my eyes and i couldnt get at it it seems like a little
thing on paper but it was not a little thing at all it was
the most real kind of misery i would not say it if it was not so 
i made up my mind that i would carry along a reticule next time 
let it look how it might and people say what they would of course
these iron dudes of the round table would think it was scandalous 
and maybe raise sheol about it but as for me give me comfort
first and style afterwards so we jogged along and now and then
we struck a stretch of dust and it would tumble up in clouds and
get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry and of course i said
things i oughtnt to have said i dont deny that i am not
better than others 

we couldnt seem to meet anybody in this lonesome britain not
even an ogre and in the mood i was in then it was well for
the ogre that is an ogre with a handkerchief most knights
would have thought of nothing but getting his armor but so i got
his bandanna he could keep his hardware for all of me 

meantime it was getting hotter and hotter in there you see 
the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more
all the time well when you are hot that way every little thing
irritates you when i trotted i rattled like a crate of dishes 
and that annoyed me and moreover i couldnt seem to stand that
shield slatting and banging now about my breast now around my
back and if i dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched
in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does and as we didnt
create any breeze at that gait i was like to get fried in that
stove and besides the quieter you went the heavier the iron
settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh
every minute and you had to be always changing hands and passing
your spear over to the other foot it got so irksome for one hand
to hold it long at a time 

well you know when you perspire that way in rivers there comes
a time when you when you well when you itch you are inside 
your hands are outside so there you are nothing but iron between 
it is not a light thing let it sound as it may first it is one
place then another then some more and it goes on spreading and
spreading and at last the territory is all occupied and nobody
can imagine what you feel like nor how unpleasant it is and
when it had got to the worst and it seemed to me that i could
not stand anything more a fly got in through the bars and settled
on my nose and the bars were stuck and wouldnt work and i
couldnt get the visor up and i could only shake my head which
was baking hot by this time and the fly well you know how a fly
acts when he has got a certainty he only minded the shaking enough
to change from nose to lip and lip to ear and buzz and buzz
all around in there and keep on lighting and biting in a way
that a person already so distressed as i was simply could not
stand so i gave in and got alisande to unship the helmet and
relieve me of it then she emptied the conveniences out of it
and fetched it full of water and i drank and then stood up and
she poured the rest down inside the armor one cannot think how
refreshing it was she continued to fetch and pour until i was
well soaked and thoroughly comfortable 

it was good to have a rest and peace but nothing is quite
perfect in this life at any time i had made a pipe a while back 
and also some pretty fair tobacco not the real thing but what
some of the indians use the inside bark of the willow dried 
these comforts had been in the helmet and now i had them again 
but no matches 

gradually as the time wore along one annoying fact was borne in
upon my understanding that we were weather bound an armed novice
cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it sandy was
not enough not enough for me anyway we had to wait until
somebody should come along waiting in silence would have been
agreeable enough for i was full of matter for reflection and
wanted to give it a chance to work i wanted to try and think out
how it was that rational or even half rational men could ever
have learned to wear armor considering its inconveniences and
how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations
when it was plain that what i had suffered to day they had had
to suffer all the days of their lives i wanted to think that out 
and moreover i wanted to think out some way to reform this evil
and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out but
thinking was out of the question in the circumstances you couldnt
think where sandy was 

she was a quite biddable creature and good hearted but she had
a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill and made your head
sore like the drays and wagons in a city if she had had a cork
she would have been a comfort but you cant cork that kind 
they would die her clack was going all day and you would think
something would surely happen to her works by and by but no 
they never got out of order and she never had to slack up for
words she could grind and pump and churn and buzz by the week 
and never stop to oil up or blow out and yet the result was just
nothing but wind she never had any ideas any more than a fog
has she was a perfect blatherskite i mean for jaw jaw jaw 
talk talk talk jabber jabber jabber but just as good as she
could be i hadnt minded her mill that morning on account of
having that hornets nest of other troubles but more than once
in the afternoon i had to say 

 take a rest child the way you are using up all the domestic air 
the kingdom will have to go to importing it by to morrow and its
a low enough treasury without that 



chapter xiii

freemen

yes it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be
contented only a little while back when i was riding and
suffering what a heaven this peace this rest this sweet serenity
in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have
seemed where i could keep perfectly comfortable all the time
by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then yet
already i was getting dissatisfied partly because i could not
light my pipe for although i had long ago started a match factory 
i had forgotten to bring matches with me and partly because we
had nothing to eat here was another illustration of the childlike
improvidence of this age and people a man in armor always trusted
to chance for his food on a journey and would have been scandalized
at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear there
was probably not a knight of all the round table combination who
would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing
as that on his flagstaff and yet there could not be anything more
sensible it had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches
into my helmet but i was interrupted in the act and had to make
an excuse and lay them aside and a dog got them 

night approached and with it a storm the darkness came on fast 
we must camp of course i found a good shelter for the demoiselle
under a rock and went off and found another for myself but
i was obliged to remain in my armor because i could not get it off
by myself and yet could not allow alisande to help because it
would have seemed so like undressing before folk it would not
have amounted to that in reality because i had clothes on
underneath but the prejudices of ones breeding are not gotten
rid of just at a jump and i knew that when it came to stripping
off that bob tailed iron petticoat i should be embarrassed 

with the storm came a change of weather and the stronger the wind
blew and the wilder the rain lashed around the colder and colder
it got pretty soon various kinds of bugs and ants and worms
and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside
my armor to get warm and while some of them behaved well enough 
and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet the majority
were of a restless uncomfortable sort and never stayed still 
but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what 
especially the ants which went tickling along in wearisome
procession from one end of me to the other by the hour and are
a kind of creatures which i never wish to sleep with again 
it would be my advice to persons situated in this way to not roll
or thrash around because this excites the interest of all the
different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want
to turn out and see what is going on and this makes things worse
than they were before and of course makes you objurgate harder 
too if you can still if one did not roll and thrash around
he would die so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other 
there is no real choice even after i was frozen solid i could
still distinguish that tickling just as a corpse does when he is
taking electric treatment i said i would never wear armor
after this trip 

all those trying hours whilst i was frozen and yet was in a living
fire as you may say on account of that swarm of crawlers that
same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my
tired head how do people stand this miserable armor how have
they managed to stand it all these generations how can they sleep
at night for dreading the tortures of next day 

when the morning came at last i was in a bad enough plight seedy 
drowsy fagged from want of sleep weary from thrashing around 
famished from long fasting pining for a bath and to get rid of
the animals and crippled with rheumatism and how had it fared
with the nobly born the titled aristocrat the demoiselle alisande
la carteloise why she was as fresh as a squirrel she had slept
like the dead and as for a bath probably neither she nor any
other noble in the land had ever had one and so she was not
missing it measured by modern standards they were merely modified
savages those people this noble lady showed no impatience to get
to breakfast and that smacks of the savage too on their journeys
those britons were used to long fasts and knew how to bear them 
and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting 
after the style of the indian and the anaconda as like as not 
sandy was loaded for a three day stretch 

we were off before sunrise sandy riding and i limping along
behind in half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor
creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded
as a road they were as humble as animals to me and when i
proposed to breakfast with them they were so flattered so
overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that
at first they were not able to believe that i was in earnest 
my lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side she said
in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the
other cattle a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely
because it referred to them and not because it insulted or offended
them for it didnt and yet they were not slaves not chattels 
by a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen seven tenths
of the free population of the country were of just their class and
degree small independent farmers artisans etc which is
to say they were the nation the actual nation they were about
all of it that was useful or worth saving or really respect worthy 
and to subtract them would have been to subtract the nation and
leave behind some dregs some refuse in the shape of a king 
nobility and gentry idle unproductive acquainted mainly with
the arts of wasting and destroying and of no sort of use or value
in any rationally constructed world and yet by ingenious
contrivance this gilded minority instead of being in the tail
of the procession where it belonged was marching head up and
banners flying at the other end of it had elected itself to be
the nation and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long
that they had come at last to accept it as a truth and not only
that but to believe it right and as it should be the priests
had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state
of things was ordained of god and so not reflecting upon how
unlike god it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms and especially
such poor transparent ones as this they had dropped the matter
there and become respectfully quiet 

the talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in
a formerly american ear they were freemen but they could not
leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his
permission they could not prepare their own bread but must have
their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery 
and pay roundly for the same they could not sell a piece of their
own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the
proceeds nor buy a piece of somebody elses without remembering
him in cash for the privilege they had to harvest his grain for him
gratis and be ready to come at a moments notice leaving their
own crop to destruction by the threatened storm they had to let
him plant fruit trees in their fields and then keep their indignation
to themselves when his heedless fruit gatherers trampled the grain
around the trees they had to smother their anger when his hunting
parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of
their patient toil they were not allowed to keep doves themselves 
and when the swarms from my lords dovecote settled on their crops
they must not lose their temper and kill a bird for awful would
the penalty be when the harvest was at last gathered then came
the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it first
the church carted off its fat tenth then the kings commissioner
took his twentieth then my lords people made a mighty inroad
upon the remainder after which the skinned freeman had liberty
to bestow the remnant in his barn in case it was worth the trouble 
there were taxes and taxes and taxes and more taxes and taxes
again and yet other taxes upon this free and independent pauper 
but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop none upon the
wasteful nobility or the all devouring church if the baron would
sleep unvexed the freeman must sit up all night after his days
work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet if the freemans
daughter but no that last infamy of monarchical government is
unprintable and finally if the freeman grown desperate with his
tortures found his life unendurable under such conditions and
sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge the gentle
church condemned him to eternal fire the gentle law buried him
at midnight at the cross roads with a stake through his back 
and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property
and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors 

and here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work
on their lord the bishops road three days each gratis every
head of a family and every son of a family three days each 
gratis and a day or so added for their servants why it was
like reading about france and the french before the ever memorable
and blessed revolution which swept a thousand years of such
villany away in one swift tidal wave of blood one a settlement
of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for
each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of
that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and
shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell 
there were two reigns of terror if we would but remember it
and consider it the one wrought murder in hot passion the other
in heartless cold blood the one lasted mere months the other had
lasted a thousand years the one inflicted death upon ten thousand
persons the other upon a hundred millions but our shudders are
all for the horrors of the minor terror the momentary terror 
so to speak whereas what is the horror of swift death by the axe 
compared with lifelong death from hunger cold insult cruelty 
and heart break what is swift death by lightning compared with
death by slow fire at the stake a city cemetery could contain the
coffins filled by that brief terror which we have all been so
diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over but all france could
hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real terror
 that unspeakably bitter and awful terror which none of us has
been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves 

these poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast
and their talk with me were as full of humble reverence for their
king and church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire 
there was something pitifully ludicrous about it i asked them
if they supposed a nation of people ever existed who with a free
vote in every mans hand would elect that a single family and its
descendants should reign over it forever whether gifted or boobies 
to the exclusion of all other families including the voters and
would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised
to dizzy summits of rank and clothed on with offensive transmissible
glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nations
families including his own 

they all looked unhit and said they didnt know that they had
never thought about it before and it hadnt ever occurred to them
that a nation could be so situated that every man could have
a say in the government i said i had seen one and that it would
last until it had an established church again they were all
unhit at first but presently one man looked up and asked me
to state that proposition again and state it slowly so it could
soak into his understanding i did it and after a little he had
the idea and he brought his fist down and said he didnt believe
a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down
in the mud and dirt in any such way and that to steal from a nation
its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes 
i said to myself 

 this ones a man if i were backed by enough of his sort i would
make a strike for the welfare of this country and try to prove
myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its
system of government 

you see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to
its institutions or its office holders the country is the real
thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing
to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are
extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out 
become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body
from winter disease and death to be loyal to rags to shout
for rags to worship rags to die for rags that is a loyalty
of unreason it is pure animal it belongs to monarchy was invented
by monarchy let monarchy keep it i was from connecticut whose
constitution declares that all political power is inherent in
the people and all free governments are founded on their authority
and instituted for their benefit and that they have at all times 
an undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of
government in such a manner as they may think expedient 

under that gospel the citizen who thinks he sees that the
commonwealths political clothes are worn out and yet holds his
peace and does not agitate for a new suit is disloyal he is
a traitor that he may be the only one who thinks he sees this
decay does not excuse him it is his duty to agitate anyway and
it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see
the matter as he does 

and now here i was in a country where a right to say how the
country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each
thousand of its population for the nine hundred and ninety four
to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose
to change it would have made the whole six shudder as one man 
it would have been so disloyal so dishonorable such putrid black
treason so to speak i was become a stockholder in a corporation
where nine hundred and ninety four of the members furnished all
the money and did all the work and the other six elected themselves
a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends it seemed
to me that what the nine hundred and ninety four dupes needed was
a new deal the thing that would have best suited the circus side
of my nature would have been to resign the boss ship and get up
an insurrection and turn it into a revolution but i knew that the
jack cade or the wat tyler who tries such a thing without first
educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely
certain to get left i had never been accustomed to getting left 
even if i do say it myself wherefore the deal which had been
for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different
pattern from the cade tyler sort 

so i did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat
munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human
sheep but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him 
after i had finished i got him to lend me a little ink from his
veins and with this and a sliver i wrote on a piece of bark 

 put him in the man factory 

and gave it to him and said 

 take it to the palace at camelot and give it into the hands of
amyas le poulet whom i call clarence and he will understand 

 he is a priest then said the man and some of the enthusiasm
went out of his face 

 how a priest didnt i tell you that no chattel of the church 
no bond slave of pope or bishop can enter my man factory didnt
i tell you that you couldnt enter unless your religion whatever
it might be was your own free property 

 marry it is so and for that i was glad wherefore it liked me not 
and bred in me a cold doubt to hear of this priest being there 

 but he isnt a priest i tell you 

the man looked far from satisfied he said 

 he is not a priest and yet can read 

 he is not a priest and yet can read yes and write too for that
matter i taught him myself the mans face cleared and it is
the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that factory 

 i i would give blood out of my heart to know that art why 
i will be your slave your 

 no you wont you wont be anybodys slave take your family
and go along your lord the bishop will confiscate your small
property but no matter clarence will fix you all right 



chapter xiv

 defend thee lord 

i paid three pennies for my breakfast and a most extravagant
price it was too seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen
persons for that money but i was feeling good by this time and
i had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway and then these
people had wanted to give me the food for nothing scant as
their provision was and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize
my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial
lift where the money would do so much more good than it would
in my helmet where these pennies being made of iron and not
stinted in weight my half dollars worth was a good deal of a
burden to me i spent money rather too freely in those days 
it is true but one reason for it was that i hadnt got the
proportions of things entirely adjusted even yet after so long
a sojourn in britain hadnt got along to where i was able to
absolutely realize that a penny in arthurs land and a couple of
dollars in connecticut were about one and the same thing just
twins as you may say in purchasing power if my start from
camelot could have been delayed a very few days i could have paid
these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint and that
would have pleased me and them too not less i had adopted
the american values exclusively in a week or two now cents 
nickels dimes quarters and half dollars and also a trifle of
gold would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through
the commercial veins of the kingdom and i looked to see this
new blood freshen up its life 

the farmers were bound to throw in something to sort of offset
my liberality whether i would or no so i let them give me a flint
and steel and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed sandy
and me on our horse i lit my pipe when the first blast of smoke
shot out through the bars of my helmet all those people broke
for the woods and sandy went over backwards and struck the ground
with a dull thud they thought i was one of those fire belching
dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other
professional liars i had infinite trouble to persuade those people
to venture back within explaining distance then i told them that
this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none
but my enemies and i promised with my hand on my heart that
if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass
before me they should see that only those who remained behind would
be struck dead the procession moved with a good deal of promptness 
there were no casualties to report for nobody had curiosity enough
to remain behind to see what would happen 

i lost some time now for these big children their fears gone 
became so ravished with wonder over my awe compelling fireworks
that i had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before
they would let me go still the delay was not wholly unproductive 
for it took all that time to get sandy thoroughly wonted to the new
thing she being so close to it you know it plugged up her
conversation mill too for a considerable while and that was
a gain but above all other benefits accruing i had learned
something i was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come
along now 

we tarried with a holy hermit that night and my opportunity
came about the middle of the next afternoon we were crossing
a vast meadow by way of short cut and i was musing absently 
hearing nothing seeing nothing when sandy suddenly interrupted
a remark which she had begun that morning with the cry 

 defend thee lord peril of life is toward 

and she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood 
i looked up and saw far off in the shade of a tree half a dozen
armed knights and their squires and straightway there was bustle
among them and tightening of saddle girths for the mount my pipe
was ready and would have been lit if i had not been lost in
thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore
to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging
anybody i lit up at once and by the time i had got a good head
of reserved steam on here they came all together too none of
those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about
 one courtly rascal at a time and the rest standing by to see fair
play no they came in a body they came with a whirr and a rush 
they came like a volley from a battery came with heads low down 
plumes streaming out behind lances advanced at a level it was
a handsome sight a beautiful sight for a man up a tree i laid
my lance in rest and waited with my heart beating till the iron
wave was just ready to break over me then spouted a column of
white smoke through the bars of my helmet you should have seen
the wave go to pieces and scatter this was a finer sight than
the other one 

but these people stopped two or three hundred yards away and
this troubled me my satisfaction collapsed and fear came 
i judged i was a lost man but sandy was radiant and was going
to be eloquent but i stopped her and told her my magic had
miscarried somehow or other and she must mount with all despatch 
and we must ride for life no she wouldnt she said that my
enchantment had disabled those knights they were not riding on 
because they couldnt wait they would drop out of their saddles
presently and we would get their horses and harness i could not
deceive such trusting simplicity so i said it was a mistake that
when my fireworks killed at all they killed instantly no the men
would not die there was something wrong about my apparatus 
i couldnt tell what but we must hurry and get away for those
people would attack us again in a minute sandy laughed and said 

 lack a day sir they be not of that breed sir launcelot will
give battle to dragons and will abide by them and will assail
them again and yet again and still again until he do conquer
and destroy them and so likewise will sir pellinore and sir aglovale
and sir carados and mayhap others but there be none else that
will venture it let the idle say what the idle will and la 
as to yonder base rufflers think ye they have not their fill 
but yet desire more 

 well then what are they waiting for why dont they leave 
nobodys hindering good land im willing to let bygones be
bygones im sure 

 leave is it oh give thyself easement as to that they dream
not of it no not they they wait to yield them 

 come really is that sooth as you people say if they want to 
why dont they 

 it would like them much but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed 
ye would not hold them blamable they fear to come 

 well then suppose i go to them instead and 

 ah wit ye well they would not abide your coming i will go 

and she did she was a handy person to have along on a raid 
i would have considered this a doubtful errand myself i presently
saw the knights riding away and sandy coming back that was
a relief i judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings
 i mean in the conversation otherwise the interview wouldnt have
been so short but it turned out that she had managed the business
well in fact admirably she said that when she told those people
i was the boss it hit them where they lived smote them sore
with fear and dread was her word and then they were ready to
put up with anything she might require so she swore them to appear
at arthurs court within two days and yield them with horse and
harness and be my knights henceforth and subject to my command 
how much better she managed that thing than i should have done
it myself she was a daisy 



chapter xv

sandys tale

 and so im proprietor of some knights said i as we rode off 
 who would ever have supposed that i should live to list up assets
of that sort i shant know what to do with them unless i raffle
them off how many of them are there sandy 

 seven please you sir and their squires 

 it is a good haul who are they where do they hang out 

 where do they hang out 

 yes where do they live 

 ah i understood thee not that will i tell eftsoons then she
said musingly and softly turning the words daintily over her
tongue hang they out hang they out where hang where do they
hang out eh right so where do they hang out of a truth the
phrase hath a fair and winsome grace and is prettily worded
withal i will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse whereby
i may peradventure learn it where do they hang out even so 
already it falleth trippingly from my tongue and forasmuch as 

 dont forget the cowboys sandy 

 cowboys 

 yes the knights you know you were going to tell me about them 
a while back you remember figuratively speaking games called 

 game 

 yes yes yes go to the bat i mean get to work on your
statistics and dont burn so much kindling getting your fire
started tell me about the knights 

 i will well and lightly will begin so they two departed and
rode into a great forest and 

 great scott 

you see i recognized my mistake at once i had set her works
a going it was my own fault she would be thirty days getting down
to those facts and she generally began without a preface and
finished without a result if you interrupted her she would either
go right along without noticing or answer with a couple of words 
and go back and say the sentence over again so interruptions
only did harm and yet i had to interrupt and interrupt pretty
frequently too in order to save my life a person would die if
he let her monotony drip on him right along all day 

 great scott i said in my distress she went right back and
began over again 

 so they two departed and rode into a great forest and 

 which two 

 sir gawaine and sir uwaine and so they came to an abbey of monks 
and there were well lodged so on the morn they heard their masses
in the abbey and so they rode forth till they came to a great
forest then was sir gawaine ware in a valley by a turret of
twelve fair damsels and two knights armed on great horses and
the damsels went to and fro by a tree and then was sir gawaine
ware how there hung a white shield on that tree and ever as the
damsels came by it they spit upon it and some threw mire upon
the shield 

 now if i hadnt seen the like myself in this country sandy 
i wouldnt believe it but ive seen it and i can just see those
creatures now parading before that shield and acting like that 
the women here do certainly act like all possessed yes and
i mean your best too societys very choicest brands the humblest
hello girl along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness 
patience modesty manners to the highest duchess in arthurs land 

 hello girl 

 yes but dont you ask me to explain its a new kind of a girl 
they dont have them here one often speaks sharply to them when
they are not the least in fault and he cant get over feeling
sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years 
its such shabby mean conduct and so unprovoked the fact is 
no gentleman ever does it though i well i myself if ive got
to confess 

 peradventure she 

 never mind her never mind her i tell you i couldnt ever explain
her so you would understand 

 even so be it sith ye are so minded then sir gawaine and
sir uwaine went and saluted them and asked them why they did that
despite to the shield sirs said the damsels we shall tell you 
there is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield 
and he is a passing good man of his hands but he hateth all
ladies and gentlewomen and therefore we do all this despite to
the shield i will say you said sir gawaine it beseemeth evil
a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen and peradventure
though he hate you he hath some cause and peradventure he loveth
in some other places ladies and gentlewomen and to be loved again 
and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of 

 man of prowess yes that is the man to please them sandy 
man of brains that is a thing they never think of tom sayers
 john heenan john l sullivan pity but you could be here you
would have your legs under the round table and a sir in front
of your names within the twenty four hours and you could bring
about a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses
of the court in another twenty four the fact is it is just
a sort of polished up court of comanches and there isnt a squaw
in it who doesnt stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert
to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt 

 and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of said sir gawaine 
now what is his name sir said they his name is marhaus the
kings son of ireland 

 son of the king of ireland you mean the other form doesnt mean
anything and look out and hold on tight now we must jump
this gully there we are all right now this horse belongs in
the circus he is born before his time 

 i know him well said sir uwaine he is a passing good knight as
any is on live 

 on live if youve got a fault in the world sandy it is that
you are a shade too archaic but it isnt any matter 

 for i saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were
gathered and that time there might no man withstand him ah said
sir gawaine damsels methinketh ye are to blame for it is to
suppose he that hung that shield there will not be long therefrom 
and then may those knights match him on horseback and that is
more your worship than thus for i will abide no longer to see
a knights shield dishonored and therewith sir uwaine and
sir gawaine departed a little from them and then were they ware
where sir marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward
them and when the twelve damsels saw sir marhaus they fled into
the turret as they were wild so that some of them fell by the way 
then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield and
said on high sir marhaus defend thee and so they ran together
that the knight brake his spear on marhaus and sir marhaus smote
him so hard that he brake his neck and the horses back 

 well that is just the trouble about this state of things 
it ruins so many horses 

 that saw the other knight of the turret and dressed him toward
marhaus and they went so eagerly together that the knight of
the turret was soon smitten down horse and man stark dead 

 another horse gone i tell you it is a custom that ought to be
broken up i dont see how people with any feeling can applaud
and support it 

 

 so these two knights came together with great random 

i saw that i had been asleep and missed a chapter but i didnt
say anything i judged that the irish knight was in trouble with
the visitors by this time and this turned out to be the case 

 that sir uwaine smote sir marhaus that his spear brast in pieces
on the shield and sir marhaus smote him so sore that horse and
man he bare to the earth and hurt sir uwaine on the left side 

 the truth is alisande these archaics are a little too simple 
the vocabulary is too limited and so by consequence descriptions
suffer in the matter of variety they run too much to level saharas
of fact and not enough to picturesque detail this throws about
them a certain air of the monotonous in fact the fights are all
alike a couple of people come together with great random
 random is a good word and so is exegesis for that matter and
so is holocaust and defalcation and usufruct and a hundred others 
but land a body ought to discriminate they come together with
great random and a spear is brast and one party brake his shield
and the other one goes down horse and man over his horse tail
and brake his neck and then the next candidate comes randoming in 
and brast his spear and the other man brast his shield and down
 he goes horse and man over his horse tail and brake his neck 
and then theres another elected and another and another and still
another till the material is all used up and when you come to
figure up results you cant tell one fight from another nor who
whipped and as a picture of living raging roaring battle 
sho why its pale and noiseless just ghosts scuffling in a fog 
dear me what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest
spectacle the burning of rome in neros time for instance 
why it would merely say town burned down no insurance boy
brast a window fireman brake his neck why that aint a picture 

it was a good deal of a lecture i thought but it didnt disturb
sandy didnt turn a feather her steam soared steadily up again 
the minute i took off the lid 

 then sir marhaus turned his horse and rode toward gawaine with
his spear and when sir gawaine saw that he dressed his shield 
and they aventred their spears and they came together with all
the might of their horses that either knight smote other so hard
in the midst of their shields but sir gawaines spear brake 

 i knew it would 

 but sir marhauss spear held and therewith sir gawaine and
his horse rushed down to the earth 

 just so and brake his back 

 and lightly sir gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out
his sword and dressed him toward sir marhaus on foot and therewith
either came unto other eagerly and smote together with their
swords that their shields flew in cantels and they bruised their
helms and their hauberks and wounded either other but sir gawaine 
fro it passed nine of the clock waxed by the space of three hours
ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased 
all this espied sir marhaus and had great wonder how his might
increased and so they wounded other passing sore and then when
it was come noon 

the pelting sing song of it carried me forward to scenes and
sounds of my boyhood days 

 n e e ew haven ten minutes for refreshments knductrll strike
the gong bell two minutes before train leaves passengers for
the shore line please take seats in the rear kyar this kyar
dont go no furder ahh pls aw rnjz b nan ners 
 s a n d ches p op corn 

 and waxed past noon and drew toward evensong sir gawaines
strength feebled and waxed passing faint that unnethes he might
dure any longer and sir marhaus was then bigger and bigger 

 which strained his armor of course and yet little would one
of these people mind a small thing like that 

 and so sir knight said sir marhaus i have well felt that
ye are a passing good knight and a marvelous man of might as ever
i felt any while it lasteth and our quarrels are not great and
therefore it were a pity to do you hurt for i feel you are passing
feeble ah said sir gawaine gentle knight ye say the word
that i should say and therewith they took off their helms and
either kissed other and there they swore together either to love
other as brethren 

but i lost the thread there and dozed off to slumber thinking
about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength
 strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome
iron and drenched with perspiration and hack and batter and bang
each other for six hours on a stretch should not have been born
at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose take
a jackass for instance a jackass has that kind of strength and
puts it to a useful purpose and is valuable to this world because
he is a jackass but a nobleman is not valuable because he is
a jackass it is a mixture that is always ineffectual and should
never have been attempted in the first place and yet once you
start a mistake the trouble is done and you never know what is
going to come of it 

when i came to myself again and began to listen i perceived that
i had lost another chapter and that alisande had wandered a long
way off with her people 

 and so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones 
and thereby they saw a fair stream of water above thereby was
the head of the stream a fair fountain and three damsels sitting
thereby in this country said sir marhaus came never knight
since it was christened but he found strange adventures 

 this is not good form alisande sir marhaus the kings son of
ireland talks like all the rest you ought to give him a brogue 
or at least a characteristic expletive by this means one would
recognize him as soon as he spoke without his ever being named 
it is a common literary device with the great authors you should
make him say in this country be jabers came never knight since
it was christened but he found strange adventures be jabers 
you see how much better that sounds 

 came never knight but he found strange adventures be jabers 
of a truth it doth indeed fair lord albeit tis passing hard
to say though peradventure that will not tarry but better speed
with usage and then they rode to the damsels and either saluted
other and the eldest had a garland of gold about her head and
she was threescore winter of age or more 

 the damsel was 

 even so dear lord and her hair was white under the garland 

 celluloid teeth nine dollars a set as like as not the loose fit
kind that go up and down like a portcullis when you eat and
fall out when you laugh 

 the second damsel was of thirty winter of age with a circlet of
gold about her head the third damsel was but fifteen year of age 

billows of thought came rolling over my soul and the voice faded
out of my hearing 

fifteen break my heart oh my lost darling just her age
who was so gentle and lovely and all the world to me and whom
i shall never see again how the thought of her carries me back
over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time a happy time so many 
many centuries hence when i used to wake in the soft summer
mornings out of sweet dreams of her and say hello central 
just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a
 hello hank that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear 
she got three dollars a week but she was worth it 

i could not follow alisandes further explanation of who our
captured knights were now i mean in case she should ever get
to explaining who they were my interest was gone my thoughts
were far away and sad by fitful glimpses of the drifting tale 
caught here and there and now and then i merely noted in a vague
way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels
up behind him on his horse and one rode north another east 
the other south to seek adventures and meet again and lie after
year and day year and day and without baggage it was of
a piece with the general simplicity of the country 

the sun was now setting it was about three in the afternoon when
alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were so she had made
pretty good progress with it for her she would arrive some time
or other no doubt but she was not a person who could be hurried 

we were approaching a castle which stood on high ground a huge 
strong venerable structure whose gray towers and battlements were
charmingly draped with ivy and whose whole majestic mass was
drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun it was the
largest castle we had seen and so i thought it might be the one
we were after but sandy said no she did not know who owned it 
she said she had passed it without calling when she went down
to camelot 



chapter xvi

morgan le fay

if knights errant were to be believed not all castles were desirable
places to seek hospitality in as a matter of fact knights errant
were not persons to be believed that is measured by modern
standards of veracity yet measured by the standards of their own
time and scaled accordingly you got the truth it was very
simple you discounted a statement ninety seven per cent the rest
was fact now after making this allowance the truth remained
that if i could find out something about a castle before ringing
the door bell i mean hailing the warders it was the sensible
thing to do so i was pleased when i saw in the distance a horseman
making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle 

as we approached each other i saw that he wore a plumed helmet 
and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel but bore a curious
addition also a stiff square garment like a heralds tabard 
however i had to smile at my own forgetfulness when i got nearer
and read this sign on his tabard 

 persimmons soap all the prime donna use it 

that was a little idea of my own and had several wholesome purposes
in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation in the
first place it was a furtive underhand blow at this nonsense
of knight errantry though nobody suspected that but me i had
started a number of these people out the bravest knights i could
get each sandwiched between bulletin boards bearing one device
or another and i judged that by and by when they got to be numerous
enough they would begin to look ridiculous and then even the
steel clad ass that hadnt any board would himself begin to look
ridiculous because he was out of the fashion 

secondly these missionaries would gradually and without creating
suspicion or exciting alarm introduce a rudimentary cleanliness
among the nobility and from them it would work down to the people 
if the priests could be kept quiet this would undermine the church 
i mean would be a step toward that next education next freedom
 and then she would begin to crumble it being my conviction that
any established church is an established crime an established
slave pen i had no scruples but was willing to assail it in
any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it why in my
own former day in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb
of time there were old englishmen who imagined that they had been
born in a free country a free country with the corporation act
and the test still in force in it timbers propped against mens
liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an established
anachronism with 

my missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their
tabards the showy gilding was a neat idea i could have got the
king to wear a bulletin board for the sake of that barbaric
splendor they were to spell out these signs and then explain to
the lords and ladies what soap was and if the lords and ladies
were afraid of it get them to try it on a dog the missionarys
next move was to get the family together and try it on himself 
he was to stop at no experiment however desperate that could
convince the nobility that soap was harmless if any final doubt
remained he must catch a hermit the woods were full of them 
saints they called themselves and saints they were believed to be 
they were unspeakably holy and worked miracles and everybody
stood in awe of them if a hermit could survive a wash and that
failed to convince a duke give him up let him alone 

whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road
they washed him and when he got well they swore him to go and
get a bulletin board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest
of his days as a consequence the workers in the field were
increasing by degrees and the reform was steadily spreading 
my soap factory felt the strain early at first i had only two
hands but before i had left home i was already employing fifteen 
and running night and day and the atmospheric result was getting
so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping
around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer 
and sir launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up
and down the roof and swear although i told him it was worse up
there than anywhere else but he said he wanted plenty of air and
he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap
factory anyway and said if a man was to start one in his house
he would be damned if he wouldnt strangle him there were ladies
present too but much these people ever cared for that they would
swear before children if the wind was their way when the factory
was going 

this missionary knights name was la cote male taile and he said
that this castle was the abode of morgan le fay sister of
king arthur and wife of king uriens monarch of a realm about
as big as the district of columbia you could stand in the middle
of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom kings and kingdoms 
were as thick in britain as they had been in little palestine in
joshuas time when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up
because they couldnt stretch out without a passport 

la cote was much depressed for he had scored here the worst
failure of his campaign he had not worked off a cake yet he had
tried all the tricks of the trade even to the washing of a hermit 
but the hermit died this was indeed a bad failure for this
animal would now be dubbed a martyr and would take his place
among the saints of the roman calendar thus made he his moan 
this poor sir la cote male taile and sorrowed passing sore and
so my heart bled for him and i was moved to comfort and stay him 
wherefore i said 

 forbear to grieve fair knight for this is not a defeat we have
brains you and i and for such as have brains there are no defeats 
but only victories observe how we will turn this seeming disaster
into an advertisement an advertisement for our soap and the
biggest one to draw that was ever thought of an advertisement
that will transform that mount washington defeat into a matterhorn
victory we will put on your bulletin board patronized by the
elect how does that strike you 

 verily it is wonderly bethought 

 well a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little
one line ad its a corker 

so the poor colporteurs griefs vanished away he was a brave
fellow and had done mighty feats of arms in his time his chief
celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one
of mine which he had once made with a damsel named maledisant 
who was as handy with her tongue as was sandy though in a different
way for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult whereas
sandys music was of a kindlier sort i knew his story well and so
i knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he
bade me farewell he supposed i was having a bitter hard time of it 

sandy and i discussed his story as we rode along and she said
that la cotes bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that
trip for the kings fool had overthrown him on the first day 
and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the
conqueror but maledisant didnt do it and also persisted afterward
in sticking to him after all his defeats but said i suppose
the victor should decline to accept his spoil she said that that
wouldnt answer he must he couldnt decline it wouldnt be
regular i made a note of that if sandys music got to be too
burdensome some time i would let a knight defeat me on the chance
that she would desert to him 

in due time we were challenged by the warders from the castle
walls and after a parley admitted i have nothing pleasant to
tell about that visit but it was not a disappointment for i knew
mrs le fay by reputation and was not expecting anything pleasant 
she was held in awe by the whole realm for she had made everybody
believe she was a great sorceress all her ways were wicked all
her instincts devilish she was loaded to the eyelids with cold
malice all her history was black with crime and among her crimes
murder was common i was most curious to see her as curious as
i could have been to see satan to my surprise she was beautiful 
black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive age
had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness 
she could have passed for old uriens granddaughter she could
have been mistaken for sister to her own son 

as soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered
into her presence king uriens was there a kind faced old man
with a subdued look and also the son sir uwaine le blanchemains 
in whom i was of course interested on account of the tradition
that he had once done battle with thirty knights and also on
account of his trip with sir gawaine and sir marhaus which sandy
had been aging me with but morgan was the main attraction the
conspicuous personality here she was head chief of this household 
that was plain she caused us to be seated and then she began 
with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses to ask me
questions dear me it was like a bird or a flute or something 
talking i felt persuaded that this woman must have been
misrepresented lied about she trilled along and trilled along 
and presently a handsome young page clothed like the rainbow and
as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave came with something
on a golden salver and kneeling to present it to her overdid
his graces and lost his balance and so fell lightly against her
knee she slipped a dirk into him in as matter of course a way as
another person would have harpooned a rat 

poor child he slumped to the floor twisted his silken limbs in
one great straining contortion of pain and was dead out of the
old king was wrung an involuntary o h of compassion the look
he got made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens
in it sir uwaine at a sign from his mother went to the anteroom
and called some servants and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly
along with her talk 

i saw that she was a good housekeeper for while she talked she
kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made
no balks in handling the body and getting it out when they came
with fresh clean towels she sent back for the other kind and
when they had finished wiping the floor and were going she indicated
a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had
overlooked it was plain to me that la cote male taile had failed
to see the mistress of the house often how louder and clearer
than any tongue does dumb circumstantial evidence speak 

morgan le fay rippled along as musically as ever marvelous woman 
and what a glance she had when it fell in reproof upon those
servants they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the
lightning flashes out of a cloud i could have got the habit
myself it was the same with that poor old brer uriens he was
always on the ragged edge of apprehension she could not even turn
toward him but he winced 

in the midst of the talk i let drop a complimentary word about
king arthur forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her
brother that one little compliment was enough she clouded up
like storm she called for her guards and said 

 hale me these varlets to the dungeons 

that struck cold on my ears for her dungeons had a reputation 
nothing occurred to me to say or do but not so with sandy 
as the guard laid a hand upon me she piped up with the tranquilest
confidence and said 

 gods wounds dost thou covet destruction thou maniac it is
the boss 

now what a happy idea that was and so simple yet it would never
have occurred to me i was born modest not all over but in spots 
and this was one of the spots 

the effect upon madame was electrical it cleared her countenance
and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and
blandishments but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up
with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright she said 

 la but do list to thine handmaid as if one gifted with powers
like to mine might say the thing which i have said unto one who
has vanquished merlin and not be jesting by mine enchantments
i foresaw your coming and by them i knew you when you entered
here i did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you
into some display of your art as not doubting you would blast
the guards with occult fires consuming them to ashes on the spot 
a marvel much beyond mine own ability yet one which i have long
been childishly curious to see 

the guards were less curious and got out as soon as they got permission 



chapter xvii

a royal banquet

madame seeing me pacific and unresentful no doubt judged that
i was deceived by her excuse for her fright dissolved away and
she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill
somebody that the thing grew to be embarrassing however to my
relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers i will
say this much for the nobility that tyrannical murderous 
rapacious and morally rotten as they were they were deeply and
enthusiastically religious nothing could divert them from the
regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the
church more than once i had seen a noble who had gotten his
enemy at a disadvantage stop to pray before cutting his throat 
more than once i had seen a noble after ambushing and despatching
his enemy retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give
thanks without even waiting to rob the body there was to be
nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even benvenuto cellini 
that rough hewn saint ten centuries later all the nobles of
britain with their families attended divine service morning and
night daily in their private chapels and even the worst of them
had family worship five or six times a day besides the credit
of this belonged entirely to the church although i was no friend
to that catholic church i was obliged to admit this and often 
in spite of me i found myself saying what would this country
be without the church 

after prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was
lighted by hundreds of grease jets and everything was as fine and
lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the
hosts at the head of the hall on a dais was the table of the
king queen and their son prince uwaine stretching down the hall
from this was the general table on the floor at this above
the salt sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their
families of both sexes the resident court in effect sixty one
persons below the salt sat minor officers of the household with
their principal subordinates altogether a hundred and eighteen
persons sitting and about as many liveried servants standing
behind their chairs or serving in one capacity or another it was
a very fine show in a gallery a band with cymbals horns harps 
and other horrors opened the proceedings with what seemed to be
the crude first draft or original agony of the wail known to later
centuries as in the sweet bye and bye it was new and ought
to have been rehearsed a little more for some reason or other
the queen had the composer hanged after dinner 

after this music the priest who stood behind the royal table said
a noble long grace in ostensible latin then the battalion of
waiters broke away from their posts and darted rushed flew 
fetched and carried and the mighty feeding began no words
anywhere but absorbing attention to business the rows of chops
opened and shut in vast unison and the sound of it was like to
the muffled burr of subterranean machinery 

the havoc continued an hour and a half and unimaginable was the
destruction of substantials of the chief feature of the feast
 the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing
at the start nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop skirt 
and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all
the other dishes 

with the pastries and so on the heavy drinking began and the talk 
gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared and everybody
got comfortable then happy then sparklingly joyous both sexes 
 and by and by pretty noisy men told anecdotes that were terrific
to hear but nobody blushed and when the nub was sprung the
assemblage let go with a horse laugh that shook the fortress 
ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made
queen margaret of navarre or even the great elizabeth of england
hide behind a handkerchief but nobody hid here but only laughed
 howled you may say in pretty much all of these dreadful stories 
ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes but that didnt worry the
chaplain any he had his laugh with the rest more than that upon
invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as
any that was sung that night 

by midnight everybody was fagged out and sore with laughing and 
as a rule drunk some weepingly some affectionately some
hilariously some quarrelsomely some dead and under the table 
of the ladies the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess whose
wedding eve this was and indeed she was a spectacle sure enough 
just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the
young daughter of the regent dorleans at the famous dinner whence
she was carried foul mouthed intoxicated and helpless to her bed 
in the lost and lamented days of the ancient regime 

suddenly even while the priest was lifting his hands and all
conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming
blessing there appeared under the arch of the far off door at
the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white haired lady 
leaning upon a crutch stick and she lifted the stick and pointed it
toward the queen and cried out 

 the wrath and curse of god fall upon you woman without pity 
who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this
old heart that had nor chick nor friend nor stay nor comfort in
all this world but him 

everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright for a curse was an
awful thing to those people but the queen rose up majestic with
the death light in her eye and flung back this ruthless command 

 lay hands on her to the stake with her 

the guards left their posts to obey it was a shame it was a
cruel thing to see what could be done sandy gave me a look 
i knew she had another inspiration i said 

 do what you choose 

she was up and facing toward the queen in a moment she indicated
me and said 

 madame he saith this may not be recall the commandment or he
will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable
fabric of a dream 

confound it what a crazy contract to pledge a person to what if
the queen 

but my consternation subsided there and my panic passed off 
for the queen all in a collapse made no show of resistance but
gave a countermanding sign and sunk into her seat when she reached
it she was sober so were many of the others the assemblage rose 
whiffed ceremony to the winds and rushed for the door like a mob 
overturning chairs smashing crockery tugging struggling 
shouldering crowding anything to get out before i should change
my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of
space well well well they were a superstitious lot it is
all a body can do to conceive of it 

the poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid
to hang the composer without first consulting me i was very sorry
for her indeed any one would have been for she was really
suffering so i was willing to do anything that was reasonable and
had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities i therefore
considered the matter thoughtfully and ended by having the
musicians ordered into our presence to play that sweet bye and
bye again which they did then i saw that she was right and
gave her permission to hang the whole band this little relaxation
of sternness had a good effect upon the queen a statesman gains
little by the arbitrary exercise of iron clad authority upon all
occasions that offer for this wounds the just pride of his
subordinates and thus tends to undermine his strength a little
concession now and then where it can do no harm is the wiser policy 

now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more and measurably
happy her wine naturally began to assert itself again and it got
a little the start of her i mean it set her music going her silver
bell of a tongue dear me she was a master talker it would not
become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that i was a tired
man and very sleepy i wished i had gone off to bed when i had
the chance now i must stick it out there was no other way so
she tinkled along and along in the otherwise profound and ghostly
hush of the sleeping castle until by and by there came as if
from deep down under us a far away sound as of a muffled shriek
 with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl 
the queen stopped and her eyes lighted with pleasure she tilted
her graceful head as a bird does when it listens the sound bored
its way up through the stillness again 

 what is it i said 

 it is truly a stubborn soul and endureth long it is many hours now 

 endureth what 

 the rack come ye shall see a blithe sight an he yield not
his secret now ye shall see him torn asunder 

what a silky smooth hellion she was and so composed and serene 
when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that
mans pain conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches 
we tramped along echoing corridors and down stone stairways dank
and dripping and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night
 a chill uncanny journey and a long one and not made the shorter
or the cheerier by the sorceresss talk which was about this
sufferer and his crime he had been accused by an anonymous
informer of having killed a stag in the royal preserves i said 

 anonymous testimony isnt just the right thing your highness 
it were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser 

 i had not thought of that it being but of small consequence 
but an i would i could not for that the accuser came masked by
night and told the forester and straightway got him hence again 
and so the forester knoweth him not 

 then is this unknown the only person who saw the stag killed 

 marry no man saw the killing but this unknown saw this hardy
wretch near to the spot where the stag lay and came with right
loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester 

 so the unknown was near the dead stag too isnt it just possible
that he did the killing himself his loyal zeal in a mask looks
just a shade suspicious but what is your highnesss idea for
racking the prisoner where is the profit 

 he will not confess else and then were his soul lost for his
crime his life is forfeited by the law and of a surety will i see
that he payeth it but it were peril to my own soul to let him
die unconfessed and unabsolved nay i were a fool to fling me
into hell for his accommodation 

 but your highness suppose he has nothing to confess 

 as to that we shall see anon an i rack him to death and he
confess not it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught
to confess ye will grant that that is sooth then shall i not be
damned for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess
 wherefore i shall be safe 

it was the stubborn unreasoning of the time it was useless to
argue with her arguments have no chance against petrified
training they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff and
her training was everybodys the brightest intellect in the land
would not have been able to see that her position was defective 

as we entered the rack cell i caught a picture that will not go
from me i wish it would a native young giant of thirty or
thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back with his
wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either
end there was no color in him his features were contorted and
set and sweat drops stood upon his forehead a priest bent over
him on each side the executioner stood by guards were on duty 
smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls in a corner
crouched a poor young creature her face drawn with anguish 
a half wild and hunted look in her eyes and in her lap lay a little
child asleep just as we stepped across the threshold the
executioner gave his machine a slight turn which wrung a cry
from both the prisoner and the woman but i shouted and the
executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke 
i could not let this horror go on it would have killed me to
see it i asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak
to the prisoner privately and when she was going to object i spoke
in a low voice and said i did not want to make a scene before
her servants but i must have my way for i was king arthurs
representative and was speaking in his name she saw she had
to yield i asked her to indorse me to these people and then
leave me it was not pleasant for her but she took the pill 
and even went further than i was meaning to require i only wanted
the backing of her own authority but she said 

 ye will do in all things as this lord shall command it is the boss 

it was certainly a good word to conjure with you could see it
by the squirming of these rats the queens guards fell into line 
and she and they marched away with their torch bearers and woke
the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their
retreating footfalls i had the prisoner taken from the rack and
placed upon his bed and medicaments applied to his hurts and
wine given him to drink the woman crept near and looked on 
eagerly lovingly but timorously like one who fears a repulse 
indeed she tried furtively to touch the mans forehead and jumped
back the picture of fright when i turned unconsciously toward
her it was pitiful to see 

 lord i said stroke him lass if you want to do anything
youre a mind to dont mind me 

why her eyes were as grateful as an animals when you do it
a kindness that it understands the baby was out of her way and
she had her cheek against the mans in a minute and her hands
fondling his hair and her happy tears running down the man
revived and caressed his wife with his eyes which was all he
could do i judged i might clear the den now and i did cleared
it of all but the family and myself then i said 

 now my friend tell me your side of this matter i know
the other side 

the man moved his head in sign of refusal but the woman looked
pleased as it seemed to me pleased with my suggestion i went on 

 you know of me 

 yes all do in arthurs realms 

 if my reputation has come to you right and straight you should
not be afraid to speak 

the woman broke in eagerly 

 ah fair my lord do thou persuade him thou canst an thou wilt 
ah he suffereth so and it is for me for me and how can i bear it 
i would i might see him die a sweet swift death oh my hugo 
i cannot bear this one 

and she fell to sobbing and grovelling about my feet and still
imploring imploring what the mans death i could not quite
get the bearings of the thing but hugo interrupted her and said 

 peace ye wit not what ye ask shall i starve whom i love 
to win a gentle death i wend thou knewest me better 

 well i said i cant quite make this out it is a puzzle now 

 ah dear my lord an ye will but persuade him consider how
these his tortures wound me oh and he will not speak whereas 
the healing the solace that lie in a blessed swift death 

 what are you maundering about hes going out from here a free
man and whole hes not going to die 

the mans white face lit up and the woman flung herself at me
in a most surprising explosion of joy and cried out 

 he is saved for it is the kings word by the mouth of the kings
servant arthur the king whose word is gold 

 well then you do believe i can be trusted after all why
didnt you before 

 who doubted not i indeed and not she 

 well why wouldnt you tell me your story then 

 ye had made no promise else had it been otherwise 

 i see i see and yet i believe i dont quite see after all 
you stood the torture and refused to confess which shows plain
enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing
to confess 

 i my lord how so it was i that killed the deer 

 you did oh dear this is the most mixed up business that ever 

 dear lord i begged him on my knees to confess but 

 you did it gets thicker and thicker what did you want him
to do that for 

 sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this
cruel pain 

 well yes there is reason in that but he didnt want the
quick death 

 he why of a surety he did 

 well then why in the world didnt he confess 

 ah sweet sir and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter 

 oh heart of gold now i see it the bitter law takes the convicted
mans estate and beggars his widow and his orphans they could
torture you to death but without conviction or confession they
could not rob your wife and baby you stood by them like a man 
and you true wife and the woman that you are you would have
bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow
starvation and death well it humbles a body to think what your
sex can do when it comes to self sacrifice ill book you both
for my colony youll like it there its a factory where im going
to turn groping and grubbing automata into men 



chapter xviii

in the queens dungeons

well i arranged all that and i had the man sent to his home 
i had a great desire to rack the executioner not because he was
a good painstaking and paingiving official for surely it was
not to his discredit that he performed his functions well but to
pay him back for wantonly cuffing and otherwise distressing that
young woman the priests told me about this and were generously
hot to have him punished something of this disagreeable sort
was turning up every now and then i mean episodes that showed
that not all priests were frauds and self seekers but that many 
even the great majority of these that were down on the ground
among the common people were sincere and right hearted and
devoted to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings 
well it was a thing which could not be helped so i seldom fretted
about it and never many minutes at a time it has never been my
way to bother much about things which you cant cure but i did
not like it for it was just the sort of thing to keep people
reconciled to an established church we must have a religion
 it goes without saying but my idea is to have it cut up into
forty free sects so that they will police each other as had been
the case in the united states in my time concentration of power
in a political machine is bad and an established church is
only a political machine it was invented for that it is nursed 
cradled preserved for that it is an enemy to human liberty and
does no good which it could not better do in a split up and scattered
condition that wasnt law it wasnt gospel it was only
an opinion my opinion and i was only a man one man so it wasnt
worth any more than the popes or any less for that matter 

well i couldnt rack the executioner neither would i overlook
the just complaint of the priests the man must be punished
somehow or other so i degraded him from his office and made him
leader of the band the new one that was to be started he begged
hard and said he couldnt play a plausible excuse but too thin 
there wasnt a musician in the country that could 

the queen was a good deal outraged next morning when she found
she was going to have neither hugos life nor his property but
i told her she must bear this cross that while by law and custom
she certainly was entitled to both the mans life and his property 
there were extenuating circumstances and so in arthur the kings
name i had pardoned him the deer was ravaging the mans fields 
and he had killed it in sudden passion and not for gain and he
had carried it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make
detection of the misdoer impossible confound her i couldnt
make her see that sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance
in the killing of venison or of a person so i gave it up and let
her sulk it out i did think i was going to make her see it by
remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the page
modified that crime 

 crime she exclaimed how thou talkest crime forsooth 
man i am going to pay for him 

oh it was no use to waste sense on her training training is
everything training is all there is to a person we speak of
nature it is folly there is no such thing as nature what we
call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training 
we have no thoughts of our own no opinions of our own they are
transmitted to us trained into us all that is original in us 
and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us can be
covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle all the
rest being atoms contributed by and inherited from a procession
of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the adam clam
or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously
and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed and as for me 
all that i think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage this
pathetic drift between the eternities is to look out and humbly
live a pure and high and blameless life and save that one
microscopic atom in me that is truly me the rest may land in
sheol and welcome for all i care 

no confound her her intellect was good she had brains enough 
but her training made her an ass that is from a many centuries later
point of view to kill the page was no crime it was her right 
and upon her right she stood serenely and unconscious of offense 
she was a result of generations of training in the unexamined and
unassailed belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject
when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one 

well we must give even satan his due she deserved a compliment
for one thing and i tried to pay it but the words stuck in my
throat she had a right to kill the boy but she was in no wise
obliged to pay for him that was law for some other people but
not for her she knew quite well that she was doing a large and
generous thing to pay for that lad and that i ought in common
fairness to come out with something handsome about it but i
couldnt my mouth refused i couldnt help seeing in my fancy 
that poor old grandma with the broken heart and that fair young
creature lying butchered his little silken pomps and vanities
laced with his golden blood how could she pay for him whom 
could she pay and so well knowing that this woman trained
as she had been deserved praise even adulation i was yet not
able to utter it trained as i had been the best i could do was
to fish up a compliment from outside so to speak and the pity
of it was that it was true 

 madame your people will adore you for this 

quite true but i meant to hang her for it some day if i lived 
some of those laws were too bad altogether too bad a master
might kill his slave for nothing for mere spite malice or
to pass the time just as we have seen that the crowned head could
do it with his slave that is to say anybody a gentleman could
kill a free commoner and pay for him cash or garden truck 
a noble could kill a noble without expense as far as the law was
concerned but reprisals in kind were to be expected any body
could kill some body except the commoner and the slave these had
no privileges if they killed it was murder and the law wouldnt
stand murder it made short work of the experimenter and of
his family too if he murdered somebody who belonged up among
the ornamental ranks if a commoner gave a noble even so much
as a damiens scratch which didnt kill or even hurt he got damiens
dose for it just the same they pulled him to rags and tatters
with horses and all the world came to see the show and crack
jokes and have a good time and some of the performances of the
best people present were as tough and as properly unprintable 
as any that have been printed by the pleasant casanova in his
chapter about the dismemberment of louis xvs poor awkward enemy 

i had had enough of this grisly place by this time and wanted
to leave but i couldnt because i had something on my mind that
my conscience kept prodding me about and wouldnt let me forget 
if i had the remaking of man he wouldnt have any conscience 
it is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person 
and although it certainly does a great deal of good it cannot
be said to pay in the long run it would be much better to have
less good and more comfort still this is only my opinion and
i am only one man others with less experience may think
differently they have a right to their view i only stand
to this i have noticed my conscience for many years and i know
it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else i started
with i suppose that in the beginning i prized it because we
prize anything that is ours and yet how foolish it was to think so 
if we look at it in another way we see how absurd it is if i had
an anvil in me would i prize it of course not and yet when you
come to think there is no real difference between a conscience
and an anvil i mean for comfort i have noticed it a thousand
times and you could dissolve an anvil with acids when you
couldnt stand it any longer but there isnt any way that you can
work off a conscience at least so it will stay worked off not
that i know of anyway 

there was something i wanted to do before leaving but it was
a disagreeable matter and i hated to go at it well it bothered
me all the morning i could have mentioned it to the old king 
but what would be the use he was but an extinct volcano he had
been active in his time but his fire was out this good while 
he was only a stately ash pile now gentle enough and kindly
enough for my purpose without doubt but not usable he was
nothing this so called king the queen was the only power there 
and she was a vesuvius as a favor she might consent to warm
a flock of sparrows for you but then she might take that very
opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city however 
i reflected that as often as any other way when you are expecting
the worst you get something that is not so bad after all 

so i braced up and placed my matter before her royal highness 
i said i had been having a general jail delivery at camelot and
among neighboring castles and with her permission i would like
to examine her collection her bric a brac that is to say her
prisoners she resisted but i was expecting that but she finally
consented i was expecting that too but not so soon that about
ended my discomfort she called her guards and torches and
we went down into the dungeons these were down under the castles
foundations and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living
rock some of these cells had no light at all in one of them was
a woman in foul rags who sat on the ground and would not answer
a question or speak a word but only looked up at us once or twice 
through a cobweb of tangled hair as if to see what casual thing
it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless
dull dream that was become her life after that she sat bowed 
with her dirt caked fingers idly interlocked in her lap and gave
no further sign this poor rack of bones was a woman of middle
age apparently but only apparently she had been there nine
years and was eighteen when she entered she was a commoner 
and had been sent here on her bridal night by sir breuse sance pite 
a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was and to which said
lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du
seigneur and moreover had opposed violence to violence and spilt
half a gill of his almost sacred blood the young husband had
interfered at that point believing the brides life in danger 
and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and
trembling wedding guests in the parlor and left him there
astonished at this strange treatment and implacably embittered
against both bride and groom the said lord being cramped for
dungeon room had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals 
and here in her bastile they had been ever since hither indeed 
they had come before their crime was an hour old and had never
seen each other since here they were kenneled like toads in the
same rock they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet
of each other yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not 
all the first years their only question had been asked with
beseechings and tears that might have moved stones in time 
perhaps but hearts are not stones is he alive is she alive 
but they had never got an answer and at last that question was
not asked any more or any other 

i wanted to see the man after hearing all this he was thirty four
years old and looked sixty he sat upon a squared block of
stone with his head bent down his forearms resting on his knees 
his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face and he was
muttering to himself he raised his chin and looked us slowly
over in a listless dull way blinking with the distress of the
torchlight then dropped his head and fell to muttering again
and took no further notice of us there were some pathetically
suggestive dumb witnesses present on his wrists and ankles were
cicatrices old smooth scars and fastened to the stone on which
he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached but this
apparatus lay idle on the ground and was thick with rust chains
cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner 

i could not rouse the man so i said we would take him to her 
and see to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him 
once roses pearls and dew made flesh for him a wonder work 
the master work of nature with eyes like no other eyes and voice
like no other voice and a freshness and lithe young grace and
beauty that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams as he
thought and to no other the sight of her would set his stagnant
blood leaping the sight of her 

but it was a disappointment they sat together on the ground and
looked dimly wondering into each others faces a while with a
sort of weak animal curiosity then forgot each others presence 
and dropped their eyes and you saw that they were away again and
wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know
nothing about 

i had them taken out and sent to their friends the queen did not
like it much not that she felt any personal interest in the matter 
but she thought it disrespectful to sir breuse sance pite however 
i assured her that if he found he couldnt stand it i would fix him
so that he could 

i set forty seven prisoners loose out of those awful rat holes 
and left only one in captivity he was a lord and had killed
another lord a sort of kinsman of the queen that other lord
had ambushed him to assassinate him but this fellow had got the
best of him and cut his throat however it was not for that that
i left him jailed but for maliciously destroying the only public
well in one of his wretched villages the queen was bound to hang
him for killing her kinsman but i would not allow it it was no
crime to kill an assassin but i said i was willing to let her
hang him for destroying the well so she concluded to put up with
that as it was better than nothing 

dear me for what trifling offenses the most of those forty seven
men and women were shut up there indeed some were there for
no distinct offense at all but only to gratify somebodys spite 
and not always the queens by any means but a friends the newest
prisoners crime was a mere remark which he had made he said
he believed that men were about all alike and one man as good
as another barring clothes he said he believed that if you were
to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd he
couldnt tell the king from a quack doctor nor a duke from a hotel
clerk apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced
to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training i set him loose and
sent him to the factory 

some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the
face of the precipice and in each of these an arrow slit had been
pierced outward to the daylight and so the captive had a thin
ray from the blessed sun for his comfort the case of one of
these poor fellows was particularly hard from his dusky swallows
hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out
through the arrow slit and see his own home off yonder in the
valley and for twenty two years he had watched it with heartache
and longing through that crack he could see the lights shine
there at night and in the daytime he could see figures go in and
come out his wife and children some of them no doubt though
he could not make out at that distance in the course of years
he noted festivities there and tried to rejoice and wondered
if they were weddings or what they might be and he noted funerals 
and they wrung his heart he could make out the coffin but he
could not determine its size and so could not tell whether it was
wife or child he could see the procession form with priests
and mourners and move solemnly away bearing the secret with
them he had left behind him five children and a wife and in
nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue and none of them
humble enough in pomp to denote a servant so he had lost five
of his treasures there must still be one remaining one now
infinitely unspeakably precious but which one wife or child 
that was the question that tortured him by night and by day 
asleep and awake well to have an interest of some sort and
half a ray of light when you are in a dungeon is a great support
to the body and preserver of the intellect this man was in pretty
good condition yet by the time he had finished telling me his
distressful tale i was in the same state of mind that you would
have been in yourself if you have got average human curiosity 
that is to say i was as burning up as he was to find out which
member of the family it was that was left so i took him over
home myself and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was too
 typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy and whole niagaras of happy
tears and by george we found the aforetime young matron graying
toward the imminent verge of her half century and the babies all
men and women and some of them married and experimenting familywise
themselves for not a soul of the tribe was dead conceive of the
ingenious devilishness of that queen she had a special hatred for
this prisoner and she had invented all those funerals herself 
to scorch his heart with and the sublimest stroke of genius of
the whole thing was leaving the family invoice a funeral short 
so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing 

but for me he never would have got out morgan le fay hated him
with her whole heart and she never would have softened toward him 
and yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than
deliberate depravity he had said she had red hair well she
had but that was no way to speak of it when red headed people
are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn 

consider it among these forty seven captives there were five
whose names offenses and dates of incarceration were no longer
known one woman and four men all bent and wrinkled and
mind extinguished patriarchs they themselves had long ago forgotten
these details at any rate they had mere vague theories about them 
nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same
way the succession of priests whose office it had been to pray
daily with the captives and remind them that god had put them
there for some wise purpose or other and teach them that patience 
humbleness and submission to oppression was what he loved to see
in parties of a subordinate rank had traditions about these poor
old human ruins but nothing more these traditions went but
little way for they concerned the length of the incarceration only 
and not the names of the offenses and even by the help of
tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of
the five had seen daylight for thirty five years how much longer
this privation has lasted was not guessable the king and the queen
knew nothing about these poor creatures except that they were
heirlooms assets inherited along with the throne from the former
firm nothing of their history had been transmitted with their
persons and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no
value and had felt no interest in them i said to the queen 

 then why in the world didnt you set them free 

the question was a puzzler she didnt know why she hadnt the
thing had never come up in her mind so here she was forecasting
the veritable history of future prisoners of the castle dif 
without knowing it it seemed plain to me now that with her
training those inherited prisoners were merely property nothing
more nothing less well when we inherit property it does not
occur to us to throw it away even when we do not value it 

when i brought my procession of human bats up into the open world
and the glare of the afternoon sun previously blindfolding them 
in charity for eyes so long untortured by light they were a
spectacle to look at skeletons scarecrows goblins pathetic
frights every one legitimatest possible children of monarchy
by the grace of god and the established church i muttered absently 

 i wish i could photograph them 

you have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they
dont know the meaning of a new big word the more ignorant they
are the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you havent
shot over their heads the queen was just one of that sort and
was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it she
hesitated a moment then her face brightened up with sudden
comprehension and she said she would do it for me 

i thought to myself she why what can she know about photography 
but it was a poor time to be thinking when i looked around she
was moving on the procession with an axe 

well she certainly was a curious one was morgan le fay i have
seen a good many kinds of women in my time but she laid over them
all for variety and how sharply characteristic of her this episode
was she had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph
a procession but being in doubt it was just like her to try
to do it with an axe 



chapter xix

knight errantry as a trade

sandy and i were on the road again next morning bright and early 
it was so good to open up ones lungs and take in whole luscious
barrels ful of the blessed gods untainted dew fashioned 
woodland scented air once more after suffocating body and mind for two
days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable
old buzzard roost i mean for me of course the place was all
right and agreeable enough for sandy for she had been used to
high life all her days 

poor girl her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while 
and i was expecting to get the consequences i was right but she
had stood by me most helpfully in the castle and had mightily
supported and reinforced me with gigantic foolishnesses which were
worth more for the occasion than wisdoms double their size so
i thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while 
if she wanted to and i felt not a pang when she started it up 

 now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty
winter of age southward 

 are you going to see if you can work up another half stretch on
the trail of the cowboys sandy 

 even so fair my lord 

 go ahead then i wont interrupt this time if i can help it 
begin over again start fair and shake out all your reefs and
i will load my pipe and give good attention 

 now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty
winter of age southward and so they came into a deep forest 
and by fortune they were nighted and rode along in a deep way 
and at the last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke
of south marches and there they asked harbour and on the morn
the duke sent unto sir marhaus and bad him make him ready and
so sir marhaus arose and armed him and there was a mass sung
afore him and he brake his fast and so mounted on horseback in
the court of the castle there they should do the battle so there
was the duke already on horseback clean armed and his six sons
by him and every each had a spear in his hand and so they
encountered whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears
upon him but sir marhaus held up his spear and touched none of
them then came the four sons by couples and two of them brake
their spears and so did the other two and all this while
sir marhaus touched them not then sir marhaus ran to the duke 
and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth 
and so he served his sons and then sir marhaus alight down and
bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him and then some
of his sons recovered and would have set upon sir marhaus then
sir marhaus said to the duke cease thy sons or else i will do
the uttermost to you all when the duke saw he might not escape
the death he cried to his sons and charged them to yield them
to sir marhaus and they kneeled all down and put the pommels
of their swords to the knight and so he received them and then
they holp up their father and so by their common assent promised
unto sir marhaus never to be foes unto king arthur and thereupon
at whitsuntide after to come he and his sons and put them in
the kings grace 

 footnote the story is borrowed language and all from the
morte darthur m t 

 even so standeth the history fair sir boss now ye shall wit
that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days
past you also did overcome and send to arthurs court 

 why sandy you cant mean it 

 an i speak not sooth let it be the worse for me 

 well well well now who would ever have thought it one
whole duke and six dukelets why sandy it was an elegant haul 
knight errantry is a most chuckle headed trade and it is tedious
hard work too but i begin to see that there is money in it 
after all if you have luck not that i would ever engage in it
as a business for i wouldnt no sound and legitimate business
can be established on a basis of speculation a successful whirl
in the knight errantry line now what is it when you blow away
the nonsense and come down to the cold facts its just a corner
in pork thats all and you cant make anything else out of it 
youre rich yes suddenly rich for about a day maybe a week 
then somebody corners the market on you and down goes your
bucket shop aint that so sandy 

 whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth bewraying simple
language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong
and overthwart 

 theres no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around
it that way sandy its so just as i say i know its so and 
moreover when you come right down to the bedrock knight errantry
is worse than pork for whatever happens the porks left and
so somebodys benefited anyway but when the market breaks in a
knight errantry whirl and every knight in the pool passes in his
checks what have you got for assets just a rubbish pile of
battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware can you
call those assets give me pork every time am i right 

 ah peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters
whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and
fortunings whereby not i alone nor you alone but every each of us 
meseemeth 

 no its not your head sandy your heads all right as far as
it goes but you dont know business thats where the trouble
is it unfits you to argue about business and youre wrong
to be always trying however that aside it was a good haul 
anyway and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in arthurs
court and speaking of the cowboys what a curious country this
is for women and men that never get old now theres morgan le fay 
as fresh and young as a vassar pullet to all appearances and
here is this old duke of the south marches still slashing away with
sword and lance at his time of life after raising such a family
as he has raised as i understand it sir gawaine killed seven
of his sons and still he had six left for sir marhaus and me to
take into camp and then there was that damsel of sixty winter
of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom how old
are you sandy 

it was the first time i ever struck a still place in her the mill
had shut down for repairs or something 



chapter xx

the ogres castle

between six and nine we made ten miles which was plenty for a
horse carrying triple man woman and armor then we stopped
for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook 

right so came by and by a knight riding and as he drew near he
made dolorous moan and by the words of it i perceived that he
was cursing and swearing yet nevertheless was i glad of his
coming for that i saw he bore a bulletin board whereon in letters
all of shining gold was writ 

 use petersons prophylactic tooth brush all the go 

i was glad of his coming for even by this token i knew him for
knight of mine it was sir madok de la montaine a burly great
fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace
of sending sir launcelot down over his horse tail once he was
never long in a strangers presence without finding some pretext
or other to let out that great fact but there was another fact
of nearly the same size which he never pushed upon anybody unasked 
and yet never withheld when asked that was that the reason he
didnt quite succeed was that he was interrupted and sent down
over horse tail himself this innocent vast lubber did not see
any particular difference between the two facts i liked him 
for he was earnest in his work and very valuable and he was so
fine to look at with his broad mailed shoulders and the grand
leonine set of his plumed head and his big shield with its quaint
device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth brush 
with motto try noyoudont this was a tooth wash that i was
introducing 

he was aweary he said and indeed he looked it but he would not
alight he said he was after the stove polish man and with this
he broke out cursing and swearing anew the bulletin boarder
referred to was sir ossaise of surluse a brave knight and of
considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions
in a tournament once with no less a mogul than sir gaheris
himself although not successfully he was of a light and laughing
disposition and to him nothing in this world was serious it was
for this reason that i had chosen him to work up a stove polish
sentiment there were no stoves yet and so there could be nothing
serious about stove polish all that the agent needed to do was
to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change 
and have them established in predilections toward neatness against
the time when the stove should appear upon the stage 

sir madok was very bitter and brake out anew with cursings he
said he had cursed his soul to rags and yet he would not get down
from his horse neither would he take any rest or listen to any
comfort until he should have found sir ossaise and settled this
account it appeared by what i could piece together of the
unprofane fragments of his statement that he had chanced upon
sir ossaise at dawn of the morning and been told that if he would
make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and
glades he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare
customers for prophylactics and tooth wash with characteristic
zeal sir madok had plunged away at once upon this quest and after
three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game and
behold it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the
dungeons the evening before poor old creatures it was all of
twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be
equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth 

 blank blank blank him said sir madok an i do not stove polish
him an i may find him leave it to me for never no knight that
hight ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide
on live an i may find him the which i have thereunto sworn a
great oath this day 

and with these words and others he lightly took his spear and
gat him thence in the middle of the afternoon we came upon one
of those very patriarchs ourselves in the edge of a poor village 
he was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not
seen for fifty years and about him and caressing him were also
descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now 
but to him these were all strangers his memory was gone his mind
was stagnant it seemed incredible that a man could outlast half
a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat but here were his old
wife and some old comrades to testify to it they could remember
him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood 
when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mothers hands
and went away into that long oblivion the people at the castle
could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man
had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense 
but this old wife knew and so did her old child who stood there
among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father
who had been to her a name a thought a formless image a tradition 
all her life and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh
and blood and set before her face 

it was a curious situation yet it is not on that account that
i have made room for it here but on account of a thing which
seemed to me still more curious to wit that this dreadful matter
brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against
these oppressors they had been heritors and subjects of cruelty
and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but
a kindness yes here was a curious revelation indeed of the
depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery their entire
being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience resignation 
dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in
this life their very imagination was dead when you can say
that of a man he has struck bottom i reckon there is no lower
deep for him 

i rather wished i had gone some other road this was not the sort
of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out
a peaceful revolution in his mind for it could not help bringing
up the unget aroundable fact that all gentle cant and philosophizing
to the contrary notwithstanding no people in the world ever did
achieve their freedom by goody goody talk and moral suasion 
it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must
 begin in blood whatever may answer afterward if history teaches
anything it teaches that what this folk needed then was a
reign of terror and a guillotine and i was the wrong man for them 

two days later toward noon sandy began to show signs of excitement
and feverish expectancy she said we were approaching the ogres
castle i was surprised into an uncomfortable shock the object
of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind this sudden
resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing
for a moment and roused up in me a smart interest sandys
excitement increased every moment and so did mine for that sort
of thing is catching my heart got to thumping you cant reason
with your heart it has its own laws and thumps about things which
the intellect scorns presently when sandy slid from the horse 
motioned me to stop and went creeping stealthily with her head
bent nearly to her knees toward a row of bushes that bordered
a declivity the thumpings grew stronger and quicker and they
kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse
over the declivity and also while i was creeping to her side on
my knees her eyes were burning now as she pointed with her
finger and said in a panting whisper 

 the castle the castle lo where it looms 

what a welcome disappointment i experienced i said 

 castle it is nothing but a pigsty a pigsty with a wattled
fence around it 

she looked surprised and distressed the animation faded out of
her face and during many moments she was lost in thought and
silent then 

 it was not enchanted aforetime she said in a musing fashion 
as if to herself and how strange is this marvel and how awful
 that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base
and shameful aspect yet to the perception of the other it is not
enchanted hath suffered no change but stands firm and stately
still girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air
from its towers and god shield us how it pricks the heart to
see again these gracious captives and the sorrow deepened in their
sweet faces we have tarried along and are to blame 

i saw my cue the castle was enchanted to me not to her it would
be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion it couldnt
be done i must just humor it so i said 

 this is a common case the enchanting of a thing to one eye and
leaving it in its proper form to another you have heard of it
before sandy though you havent happened to experience it 
but no harm is done in fact it is lucky the way it is if these
ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves it would be
necessary to break the enchantment and that might be impossible
if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment 
and hazardous too for in attempting a disenchantment without the
true key you are liable to err and turn your hogs into dogs 
and the dogs into cats the cats into rats and so on and end by
reducing your materials to nothing finally or to an odorless gas
which you cant follow which of course amounts to the same
thing but here by good luck no ones eyes but mine are under
the enchantment and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it 
these ladies remain ladies to you and to themselves and to
everybody else and at the same time they will suffer in no way
from my delusion for when i know that an ostensible hog is a
lady that is enough for me i know how to treat her 

 thanks oh sweet my lord thou talkest like an angel and i know
that thou wilt deliver them for that thou art minded to great
deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will
and to do as any that is on live 

 i will not leave a princess in the sty sandy are those three
yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine herds 

 the ogres are they changed also it is most wonderful now
am i fearful for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of
their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible ah go warily 
fair sir this is a mightier emprise than i wend 

 you be easy sandy all i need to know is how much of an ogre
is invisible then i know how to locate his vitals dont you be
afraid i will make short work of these bunco steerers stay
where you are 

i left sandy kneeling there corpse faced but plucky and hopeful 
and rode down to the pigsty and struck up a trade with the
swine herds i won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs
at the lump sum of sixteen pennies which was rather above latest
quotations i was just in time for the church the lord of the
manor and the rest of the tax gatherers would have been along
next day and swept off pretty much all the stock leaving the
swine herds very short of hogs and sandy out of princesses but
now the tax people could be paid in cash and there would be
a stake left besides one of the men had ten children and he
said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took
the fattest one for tithes the wife burst out upon him and offered
him a child and said 

 thou beast without bowels of mercy why leave me my child yet
rob me of the wherewithal to feed it 

how curious the same thing had happened in the wales of my day 
under this same old established church which was supposed by many
to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise 

i sent the three men away and then opened the sty gate and beckoned
sandy to come which she did and not leisurely but with the rush
of a prairie fire and when i saw her fling herself upon those
hogs with tears of joy running down her cheeks and strain them
to her heart and kiss them and caress them and call them
reverently by grand princely names i was ashamed of her ashamed
of the human race 

we had to drive those hogs home ten miles and no ladies were
ever more fickle minded or contrary they would stay in no road 
no path they broke out through the brush on all sides and flowed
away in all directions over rocks and hills and the roughest
places they could find and they must not be struck or roughly
accosted sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming
their rank the troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called
my lady and your highness like the rest it is annoying and
difficult to scour around after hogs in armor there was one
small countess with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair
on her back that was the devil for perversity she gave me a race
of an hour over all sorts of country and then we were right where
we had started from having made not a rod of real progress 
i seized her at last by the tail and brought her along squealing 
when i overtook sandy she was horrified and said it was in the
last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train 

we got the hogs home just at dark most of them the princess
nerovens de morganore was missing and two of her ladies in waiting 
namely miss angela bohun and the demoiselle elaine courtemains 
the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star
in her forehead and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a
slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side a couple
of the tryingest blisters to drive that i ever saw also among
the missing were several mere baronesses and i wanted them to
stay missing but no all that sausage meat had to be found so
servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills
to that end 

of course the whole drove was housed in the house and great
guns well i never saw anything like it nor ever heard anything
like it and never smelt anything like it it was like an
insurrection in a gasometer 



chapter xxi

the pilgrims

when i did get to bed at last i was unspeakably tired the stretching
out and the relaxing of the long tense muscles how luxurious 
how delicious but that was as far as i could get sleep was out of
the question for the present the ripping and tearing and squealing
of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium
come again and kept me broad awake being awake my thoughts
were busy of course and mainly they busied themselves with sandys
curious delusion here she was as sane a person as the kingdom
could produce and yet from my point of view she was acting like
a crazy woman my land the power of training of influence 
of education it can bring a body up to believe anything i had
to put myself in sandys place to realize that she was not a
lunatic yes and put her in mine to demonstrate how easy it is
to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have
been taught if i had told sandy i had seen a wagon uninfluenced
by enchantment spin along fifty miles an hour had seen a man 
unequipped with magic powers get into a basket and soar out of
sight among the clouds and had listened without any necromancers
help to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles
away sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy she
would have thought she knew it everybody around her believed in
enchantments nobody had any doubts to doubt that a castle could
be turned into a sty and its occupants into hogs would have been
the same as my doubting among connecticut people the actuality
of the telephone and its wonders and in both cases would be
absolute proof of a diseased mind an unsettled reason yes sandy
was sane that must be admitted if i also would be sane to sandy
 i must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous
locomotives balloons and telephones to myself also i believed
that the world was not flat and hadnt pillars under it to support
it nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that
occupied all space above but as i was the only person in the kingdom
afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions i recognized
that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter too 
if i did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody
as a madman 

the next morning sandy assembled the swine in the dining room and
gave them their breakfast waiting upon them personally and
manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of
her island ancient and modern have always felt for rank let its
outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may 
i could have eaten with the hogs if i had had birth approaching my
lofty official rank but i hadnt and so accepted the unavoidable
slight and made no complaint sandy and i had our breakfast at
the second table the family were not at home i said 

 how many are in the family sandy and where do they keep themselves 

 family 

 yes 

 which family good my lord 

 why this family your own family 

 sooth to say i understand you not i have no family 

 no family why sandy isnt this your home 

 now how indeed might that be i have no home 

 well then whose house is this 

 ah wit you well i would tell you an i knew myself 

 come you dont even know these people then who invited us here 

 none invited us we but came that is all 

 why woman this is a most extraordinary performance the
effrontery of it is beyond admiration we blandly march into
a mans house and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility
the sun has yet discovered in the earth and then it turns out
that we dont even know the mans name how did you ever venture
to take this extravagant liberty i supposed of course it was
your home what will the man say 

 what will he say forsooth what can he say but give thanks 

 thanks for what 

her face was filled with a puzzled surprise 

 verily thou troublest mine understanding with strange words 
do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice
in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace
his house withal 

 well no when you come to that no its an even bet that this
is the first time he has had a treat like this 

 then let him be thankful and manifest the same by grateful speech
and due humility he were a dog else and the heir and ancestor
of dogs 

to my mind the situation was uncomfortable it might become more so 
it might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on so i said 

 the day is wasting sandy it is time to get the nobility together
and be moving 

 wherefore fair sir and boss 

 we want to take them to their home dont we 

 la but list to him they be of all the regions of the earth 
each must hie to her own home wend you we might do all these
journeys in one so brief life as he hath appointed that created
life and thereto death likewise with help of adam who by sin
done through persuasion of his helpmeet she being wrought upon
and bewrayed by the beguilements of the great enemy of man that
serpent hight satan aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that
evil work by overmastering spite and envy begotten in his heart
through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature erst
so white and pure whenso it hove with the shining multitudes
its brethren born in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein
all such as native be to that rich estate and 

 great scott 

 my lord 

 well you know we havent got time for this sort of thing dont
you see we could distribute these people around the earth in less
time than it is going to take you to explain that we cant we
mustnt talk now we must act you want to be careful you mustnt
let your mill get the start of you that way at a time like this 
to business now and sharps the word who is to take the
aristocracy home 

 even their friends these will come for them from the far parts
of the earth 

this was lightning from a clear sky for unexpectedness and the
relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner she would remain to
deliver the goods of course 

 well then sandy as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully
ended i will go home and report and if ever another one 

 i also am ready i will go with thee 

this was recalling the pardon 

 how you will go with me why should you 

 will i be traitor to my knight dost think that were dishonor 
i may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field
some overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me 
i were to blame an i thought that that might ever hap 

 elected for the long term i sighed to myself i may as well
make the best of it so then i spoke up and said 

 all right let us make a start 

while she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork i gave that
whole peerage away to the servants and i asked them to take
a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly
lodged and promenaded but they considered that that would be
hardly worth while and would moreover be a rather grave departure
from custom and therefore likely to make talk a departure from
custom that settled it it was a nation capable of committing any
crime but that the servants said they would follow the fashion 
a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance they would
scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls and then the
evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible 
it was a kind of satire on nature it was the scientific method 
the geologic method it deposited the history of the family in
a stratified record and the antiquary could dig through it and
tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family
had introduced successively for a hundred years 

the first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims 
it was not going our way but we joined it nevertheless for it
was hourly being borne in upon me now that if i would govern
this country wisely i must be posted in the details of its life 
and not at second hand but by personal observation and scrutiny 

this company of pilgrims resembled chaucers in this that it
had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions
the country could show and a corresponding variety of costume 
there were young men and old men young women and old women 
lively folk and grave folk they rode upon mules and horses and
there was not a side saddle in the party for this specialty was
to remain unknown in england for nine hundred years yet 

it was a pleasant friendly sociable herd pious happy merry and
full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies what
they regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused
no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best english
society twelve centuries later practical jokes worthy of the
english wits of the first quarter of the far off nineteenth century
were sprung here and there and yonder along the line and compelled
the delightedest applause and sometimes when a bright remark was
made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward
the other you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling
spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along 
and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake 

sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage and she posted
me she said 

 they journey to the valley of holiness for to be blessed of the
godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed
from sin 

 where is this watering place 

 it lieth a two day journey hence by the borders of the land that
hight the cuckoo kingdom 

 tell me about it is it a celebrated place 

 oh of a truth yes there be none more so of old time there
lived there an abbot and his monks belike were none in the world
more holy than these for they gave themselves to study of pious
books and spoke not the one to the other or indeed to any and
ate decayed herbs and naught thereto and slept hard and prayed
much and washed never also they wore the same garment until it
fell from their bodies through age and decay right so came they
to be known of all the world by reason of these holy austerities 
and visited by rich and poor and reverenced 

 proceed 

 but always there was lack of water there whereas upon a time 
the holy abbot prayed and for answer a great stream of clear
water burst forth by miracle in a desert place now were the
fickle monks tempted of the fiend and they wrought with their
abbot unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct
a bath and when he was become aweary and might not resist more 
he said have ye your will then and granted that they asked 
now mark thou what tis to forsake the ways of purity the which
he loveth and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense 
these monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as
white as snow and lo in that moment his sign appeared in
miraculous rebuke for his insulted waters ceased to flow and
utterly vanished away 

 they fared mildly sandy considering how that kind of crime
is regarded in this country 

 belike but it was their first sin and they had been of perfect
life for long and differing in naught from the angels prayers 
tears torturings of the flesh all was vain to beguile that water
to flow again even processions even burnt offerings even votive
candles to the virgin did fail every each of them and all in
the land did marvel 

 how odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics 
and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero 
and everything come to a standstill go on sandy 

 and so upon a time after year and day the good abbot made humble
surrender and destroyed the bath and behold his anger was in that
moment appeased and the waters gushed richly forth again and even
unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure 

 then i take it nobody has washed since 

 he that would essay it could have his halter free yes and
swiftly would he need it too 

 the community has prospered since 

 even from that very day the fame of the miracle went abroad
into all lands from every land came monks to join they came
even as the fishes come in shoals and the monastery added building
to building and yet others to these and so spread wide its arms
and took them in and nuns came also and more again and yet
more and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the
vale and added building to building until mighty was that nunnery 
and these were friendly unto those and they joined their loving
labors together and together they built a fair great foundling
asylum midway of the valley between 

 you spoke of some hermits sandy 

 these have gathered there from the ends of the earth a hermit
thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims ye shall not
find no hermit of no sort wanting if any shall mention a hermit
of a kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far
strange land let him but scratch among the holes and caves and
swamps that line that valley of holiness and whatsoever be his
breed it skills not he shall find a sample of it there 

i closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good humored
face purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further
crumbs of fact but i had hardly more than scraped acquaintance
with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up in the
immemorial way to that same old anecdote the one sir dinadan
told me what time i got into trouble with sir sagramor and was
challenged of him on account of it i excused myself and dropped
to the rear of the procession sad at heart willing to go hence
from this troubled life this vale of tears this brief day of
broken rest of cloud and storm of weary struggle and monotonous
defeat and yet shrinking from the change as remembering how long
eternity is and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote 

early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims 
but in this one was no merriment no jokes no laughter no playful
ways nor any happy giddiness whether of youth or age yet both
were here both age and youth gray old men and women strong men
and women of middle age young husbands young wives little boys
and girls and three babies at the breast even the children were
smileless there was not a face among all these half a hundred
people but was cast down and bore that set expression of hopelessness
which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with
despair they were slaves chains led from their fettered feet
and their manacled hands to a sole leather belt about their waists 
and all except the children were also linked together in a file
six feet apart by a single chain which led from collar to collar
all down the line they were on foot and had tramped three
hundred miles in eighteen days upon the cheapest odds and ends
of food and stingy rations of that they had slept in these
chains every night bundled together like swine they had upon
their bodies some poor rags but they could not be said to be
clothed their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and
made sores which were ulcerated and wormy their naked feet were
torn and none walked without a limp originally there had been a
hundred of these unfortunates but about half had been sold on
the trip the trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried
a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into
several knotted tails at the end with this whip he cut the
shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain and
straightened them up he did not speak the whip conveyed his
desire without that none of these poor creatures looked up as
we rode along by they showed no consciousness of our presence 
and they made no sound but one that was the dull and awful clank
of their chains from end to end of the long file as forty three
burdened feet rose and fell in unison the file moved in a cloud
of its own making 

all these faces were gray with a coating of dust one has seen
the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses and
has written his idle thought in it with his finger i was reminded
of this when i noticed the faces of some of those women young
mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom how
a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their
faces plain to see and lord how plain to read for it was the
track of tears one of these young mothers was but a girl and
it hurt me to the heart to read that writing and reflect that it
was come up out of the breast of such a child a breast that ought
not to know trouble yet but only the gladness of the morning of
life and no doubt 

she reeled just then giddy with fatigue and down came the lash
and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder it stung me
as if i had been hit instead the master halted the file and
jumped from his horse he stormed and swore at this girl and
said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness and as this
was the last chance he should have he would settle the account now 
she dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg 
and cry and implore in a passion of terror but the master gave
no attention he snatched the child from her and then made the
men slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on
the ground and hold her there and expose her body and then he
laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed she
shrieking and struggling the while piteously one of the men who
was holding her turned away his face and for this humanity he was
reviled and flogged 

all our pilgrims looked on and commented on the expert way in
which the whip was handled they were too much hardened by lifelong
everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything
else in the exhibition that invited comment this was what slavery
could do in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior
lobe of human feeling for these pilgrims were kind hearted people 
and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that 

i wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free but that
would not do i must not interfere too much and get myself a name
for riding over the countrys laws and the citizens rights
roughshod if i lived and prospered i would be the death of
slavery that i was resolved upon but i would try to fix it so
that when i became its executioner it should be by command of
the nation 

just here was the wayside shop of a smith and now arrived a landed
proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back deliverable
here where her irons could be taken off they were removed then
there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to
which should pay the blacksmith the moment the girl was delivered
from her irons she flung herself all tears and frantic sobbings 
into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she
was whipped he strained her to his breast and smothered her
face and the childs with kisses and washed them with the rain
of his tears i suspected i inquired yes i was right it was
husband and wife they had to be torn apart by force the girl
had to be dragged away and she struggled and fought and shrieked
like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight and
even after that we could still make out the fading plaint of those
receding shrieks and the husband and father with his wife and
child gone never to be seen by him again in life well the look
of him one might not bear at all and so i turned away but i knew
i should never get his picture out of my mind again and there
it is to this day to wring my heartstrings whenever i think of it 

we put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall and when
i rose next morning and looked abroad i was ware where a knight
came riding in the golden glory of the new day and recognized him
for knight of mine sir ozana le cure hardy he was in the
gentlemens furnishing line and his missionarying specialty was
plug hats he was clothed all in steel in the beautifulest armor
of the time up to where his helmet ought to have been but he
hadnt any helmet he wore a shiny stove pipe hat and was ridiculous
a spectacle as one might want to see it was another of my
surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it
grotesque and absurd sir ozanas saddle was hung about with
leather hat boxes and every time he overcame a wandering knight
he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made
him wear it i dressed and ran down to welcome sir ozana and
get his news 

 how is trade i asked 

 ye will note that i have but these four left yet were they sixteen
whenas i got me from camelot 

 why you have certainly done nobly sir ozana where have you
been foraging of late 

 i am but now come from the valley of holiness please you sir 

 i am pointed for that place myself is there anything stirring
in the monkery more than common 

 by the mass ye may not question it give him good feed 
boy and stint it not an thou valuest thy crown so get ye lightly
to the stable and do even as i bid sir it is parlous news
i bring and be these pilgrims then ye may not do better good
folk than gather and hear the tale i have to tell sith it
concerneth you forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find 
and seek that ye will seek in vain my life being hostage for my
word and my word and message being these namely that a hap
has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once
this two hundred years which was the first and last time that
that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by
commandment of the most high whereto by reasons just and causes
thereunto contributing wherein the matter 

 the miraculous fount hath ceased to flow this shout burst from
twenty pilgrim mouths at once 

 ye say well good people i was verging to it even when ye spake 

 has somebody been washing again 

 nay it is suspected but none believe it it is thought to be
some other sin but none wit what 

 how are they feeling about the calamity 

 none may describe it in words the fount is these nine days dry 
the prayers that did begin then and the lamentations in sackcloth
and ashes and the holy processions none of these have ceased
nor night nor day and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings
be all exhausted and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment 
sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice and at last
they sent for thee sir boss to try magic and enchantment and
if you could not come then was the messenger to fetch merlin 
and he is there these three days now and saith he will fetch that
water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish
it and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his
hellions to hie them hither and help but not a whiff of moisture
hath he started yet even so much as might qualify as mist upon
a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth
betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task and if ye 

breakfast was ready as soon as it was over i showed to sir ozana
these words which i had written on the inside of his hat chemical
department laboratory extension section g pxxp send two of
first size two of no and six of no together with the proper
complementary details and two of my trained assistants and i said 

 now get you to camelot as fast as you can fly brave knight and
show the writing to clarence and tell him to have these required
matters in the valley of holiness with all possible dispatch 

 i will well sir boss and he was off 



chapter xxii

the holy fountain

the pilgrims were human beings otherwise they would have acted
differently they had come a long and difficult journey and now
when the journey was nearly finished and they learned that the main
thing they had come for had ceased to exist they didnt do as
horses or cats or angle worms would probably have done turn back
and get at something profitable no anxious as they had before
been to see the miraculous fountain they were as much as forty
times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be 
there is no accounting for human beings 

we made good time and a couple of hours before sunset we stood
upon the high confines of the valley of holiness and our eyes
swept it from end to end and noted its features that is its
large features these were the three masses of buildings they
were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions
in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert and was such a scene
is always mournful it is so impressively still and looks so
steeped in death but there was a sound here which interrupted
the stillness only to add to its mournfulness this was the faint
far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the
passing breeze and so faintly so softly that we hardly knew
whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits 

we reached the monastery before dark and there the males were
given lodging but the women were sent over to the nunnery the
bells were close at hand now and their solemn booming smote
upon the ear like a message of doom a superstitious despair
possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his
ghastly face everywhere these black robed soft sandaled 
tallow visaged specters appeared flitted about and disappeared 
noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream and as uncanny 

the old abbots joy to see me was pathetic even to tears but
he did the shedding himself he said 

 delay not son but get to thy saving work an we bring not
the water back again and soon we are ruined and the good work
of two hundred years must end and see thou do it with enchantments
that be holy for the church will not endure that work in her cause
be done by devils magic 

 when i work father be sure there will be no devils work
connected with it i shall use no arts that come of the devil 
and no elements not created by the hand of god but is merlin
working strictly on pious lines 

 ah he said he would my son he said he would and took oath
to make his promise good 

 well in that case let him proceed 

 but surely you will not sit idle by but help 

 it will not answer to mix methods father neither would it be
professional courtesy two of a trade must not underbid each
other we might as well cut rates and be done with it it would
arrive at that in the end merlin has the contract no other
magician can touch it till he throws it up 

 but i will take it from him it is a terrible emergency and the
act is thereby justified and if it were not so who will give
law to the church the church giveth law to all and what she
wills to do that she may do hurt whom it may i will take it
from him you shall begin upon the moment 

 it may not be father no doubt as you say where power is
supreme one can do as one likes and suffer no injury but we poor
magicians are not so situated merlin is a very good magician
in a small way and has quite a neat provincial reputation he
is struggling along doing the best he can and it would not be
etiquette for me to take his job until he himself abandons it 

the abbots face lighted 

 ah that is simple there are ways to persuade him to abandon it 

 no no father it skills not as these people say if he were
persuaded against his will he would load that well with a malicious
enchantment which would balk me until i found out its secret 
it might take a month i could set up a little enchantment of
mine which i call the telephone and he could not find out its
secret in a hundred years yes you perceive he might block me
for a month would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this 

 a month the mere thought of it maketh me to shudder have it
thy way my son but my heart is heavy with this disappointment 
leave me and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting 
even as i have done these ten long days counterfeiting thus
the thing that is called rest the prone body making outward sign
of repose where inwardly is none 

of course it would have been best all round for merlin to waive
etiquette and quit and call it half a day since he would never be
able to start that water for he was a true magician of the time 
which is to say the big miracles the ones that gave him his
reputation always had the luck to be performed when nobody but
merlin was present he couldnt start this well with all this crowd
around to see a crowd was as bad for a magicians miracle in
that day as it was for a spiritualists miracle in mine there was
sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial
moment and spoil everything but i did not want merlin to retire
from the job until i was ready to take hold of it effectively
myself and i could not do that until i got my things from camelot 
and that would take two or three days 

my presence gave the monks hope and cheered them up a good deal 
insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time
in ten days as soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced
with food their spirits began to rise fast when the mead began to
go round they rose faster by the time everybody was half seas over 
the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it so we
stayed by the board and put it through on that line matters got
to be very jolly good old questionable stories were told that made
the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round
bellies shake with laughter and questionable songs were bellowed out
in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells 

at last i ventured a story myself and vast was the success of it 
not right off of course for the native of those islands does
not as a rule dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous
thing but the fifth time i told it they began to crack in places 
the eight time i told it they began to crumble at the twelfth
repetition they fell apart in chunks and at the fifteenth they
disintegrated and i got a broom and swept them up this language
is figurative those islanders well they are slow pay at first 
in the matter of return for your investment of effort but in the end
they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast 

i was at the well next day betimes merlin was there enchanting
away like a beaver but not raising the moisture he was not in
a pleasant humor and every time i hinted that perhaps this contract
was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and
cursed like a bishop french bishop of the regency days i mean 

matters were about as i expected to find them the fountain was
an ordinary well it had been dug in the ordinary way and stoned up
in the ordinary way there was no miracle about it even the lie
that had created its reputation was not miraculous i could have
told it myself with one hand tied behind me the well was in a
dark chamber which stood in the center of a cut stone chapel whose
walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would
have made a chromo feel good pictures historically commemorative
of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when
nobody was looking that is nobody but angels they are always
on deck when there is a miracle to the fore so as to get put in
the picture perhaps angels are as fond of that as a fire company 
look at the old masters 

the well chamber was dimly lighted by lamps the water was drawn
with a windlass and chain by monks and poured into troughs which
delivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapel when
there was water to draw i mean and none but monks could enter
the well chamber i entered it for i had temporary authority
to do so by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate 
but he hadnt entered it himself he did everything by incantations 
he never worked his intellect if he had stepped in there and used
his eyes instead of his disordered mind he could have cured
the well by natural means and then turned it into a miracle in
the customary way but no he was an old numskull a magician who
believed in his own magic and no magician can thrive who is
handicapped with a superstition like that 

i had an idea that the well had sprung a leak that some of the
wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that
allowed the water to escape i measured the chain feet then
i called in a couple of monks locked the door took a candle and
made them lower me in the bucket when the chain was all paid out 
the candle confirmed my suspicion a considerable section of the
wall was gone exposing a good big fissure 

i almost regretted that my theory about the wells trouble was
correct because i had another one that had a showy point or two
about it for a miracle i remembered that in america many
centuries later when an oil well ceased to flow they used to
blast it out with a dynamite torpedo if i should find this well
dry and no explanation of it i could astonish these people most
nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite
bomb into it it was my idea to appoint merlin however it was
plain that there was no occasion for the bomb one cannot have
everything the way he would like it a man has no business to
be depressed by a disappointment anyway he ought to make up his
mind to get even that is what i did i said to myself i am in no
hurry i can wait that bomb will come good yet and it did too 

when i was above ground again i turned out the monks and let down
a fish line the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep and there
was forty one feet of water in it i called in a monk and asked 

 how deep is the well 

 that sir i wit not having never been told 

 how does the water usually stand in it 

 near to the top these two centuries as the testimony goeth 
brought down to us through our predecessors 

it was true as to recent times at least for there was witness
to it and better witness than a monk only about twenty or thirty
feet of the chain showed wear and use the rest of it was unworn
and rusty what had happened when the well gave out that other
time without doubt some practical person had come along and
mended the leak and then had come up and told the abbot he had
discovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed
the well would flow again the leak had befallen again now and
these children would have prayed and processioned and tolled
their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew
away and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop
a fish line into the well or go down in it and find out what was
really the matter old habit of mind is one of the toughest things
to get away from in the world it transmits itself like physical
form and feature and for a man in those days to have had an idea
that his ancestors hadnt had would have brought him under suspicion
of being illegitimate i said to the monk 

 it is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well but we
will try if my brother merlin fails brother merlin is a very
passable artist but only in the parlor magic line and he may
not succeed in fact is not likely to succeed but that should
be nothing to his discredit the man that can do this kind of
miracle knows enough to keep hotel 

 hotel i mind not to have heard 

 of hotel its what you call hostel the man that can do this
miracle can keep hostel i can do this miracle i shall do this
miracle yet i do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle
to tax the occult powers to the last strain 

 none knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood indeed for
it is of record that aforetime it was parlous difficult and took
a year natheless god send you good success and to that end
will we pray 

as a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around
that the thing was difficult many a small thing has been made
large by the right kind of advertising that monk was filled up
with the difficulty of this enterprise he would fill up the others 
in two days the solicitude would be booming 

on my way home at noon i met sandy she had been sampling the
hermits i said 

 i would like to do that myself this is wednesday is there
a matinee 

 a which please you sir 

 matinee do they keep open afternoons 

 who 

 the hermits of course 

 keep open 

 yes keep open isnt that plain enough do they knock off at noon 

 knock off 

 knock off yes knock off what is the matter with knock off 
i never saw such a dunderhead cant you understand anything at all 
in plain terms do they shut up shop draw the game bank the fires 

 shut up shop draw 

 there never mind let it go you make me tired you cant seem
to understand the simplest thing 

 i would i might please thee sir and it is to me dole and sorrow
that i fail albeit sith i am but a simple damsel and taught of
none being from the cradle unbaptized in those deep waters of
learning that do anoint with a sovereignty him that partaketh of
that most noble sacrament investing him with reverend state to
the mental eye of the humble mortal who by bar and lack of that
great consecration seeth in his own unlearned estate but a symbol
of that other sort of lack and loss which men do publish to the
pitying eye with sackcloth trappings whereon the ashes of grief
do lie bepowdered and bestrewn and so when such shall in the
darkness of his mind encounter these golden phrases of high mystery 
these shut up shops and draw the game and bank the fires it is
but by the grace of god that he burst not for envy of the mind that
can beget and tongue that can deliver so great and mellow sounding
miracles of speech and if there do ensue confusion in that humbler
mind and failure to divine the meanings of these wonders then
if so be this miscomprehension is not vain but sooth and true 
wit ye well it is the very substance of worshipful dear homage and
may not lightly be misprized nor had been an ye had noted this
complexion of mood and mind and understood that that i would
i could not and that i could not i might not nor yet nor might
 nor could nor might not nor could not might be by advantage
turned to the desired would and so i pray you mercy of my fault 
and that ye will of your kindness and your charity forgive it good
my master and most dear lord 

i couldnt make it all out that is the details but i got the
general idea and enough of it too to be ashamed it was not
fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the
untutored infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she
couldnt get their drift and when she was making the honest best
drive at it she could too and no fault of hers that she couldnt
fetch the home plate and so i apologized then we meandered
pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse
together and better friends than ever 

i was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence
for this girl nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station
and got her train fairly started on one of those horizonless
transcontinental sentences of hers it was borne in upon me that
i was standing in the awful presence of the mother of the german
language i was so impressed with this that sometimes when she
began to empty one of these sentences on me i unconsciously took
the very attitude of reverence and stood uncovered and if words
had been water i had been drowned sure she had exactly the
german way whatever was in her mind to be delivered whether a
mere remark or a sermon or a cyclopedia or the history of a war 
she would get it into a single sentence or die whenever the literary
german dives into a sentence that is the last you are going to see
of him till he emerges on the other side of his atlantic with his
verb in his mouth 

we drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon it was a most
strange menagerie the chief emulation among them seemed to be 
to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous
with vermin their manner and attitudes were the last expression
of complacent self righteousness it was one anchorites pride
to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister
him unmolested it was anothers to lean against a rock all day
long conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims
and pray it was anothers to go naked and crawl around on all fours 
it was anothers to drag about with him year in and year out 
eighty pounds of iron it was anothers to never lie down when
he slept but to stand among the thorn bushes and snore when there
were pilgrims around to look a woman who had the white hair of
age and no other apparel was black from crown to heel with
forty seven years of holy abstinence from water groups of gazing
pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects lost
in reverent wonder and envious of the fleckless sanctity which
these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven 

by and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones he was
a mighty celebrity his fame had penetrated all christendom the
noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe
to pay him reverence his stand was in the center of the widest part
of the valley and it took all that space to hold his crowds 

his stand was a pillar sixty feet high with a broad platform on
the top of it he was now doing what he had been doing every day
for twenty years up there bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly
almost to his feet it was his way of praying i timed him with a
stop watch and he made revolutions in minutes and
 seconds it seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste 
it was one of the most useful motions in mechanics the pedal
movement so i made a note in my memorandum book purposing some
day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing
machine with it i afterward carried out that scheme and got
five years good service out of him in which time he turned out
upward of eighteen thousand first rate tow linen shirts which
was ten a day i worked him sundays and all he was going sundays 
the same as week days and it was no use to waste the power 
these shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the
materials i furnished those myself it would not have been right
to make him do that and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a
dollar and a half apiece which was the price of fifty cows or
a blooded race horse in arthurdom they were regarded as a perfect
protection against sin and advertised as such by my knights
everywhere with the paint pot and stencil plate insomuch that
there was not a cliff or a bowlder or a dead wall in england but
you could read on it at a mile distance 

 buy the only genuine st stylite patronized by the nobility 
patent applied for 

there was more money in the business than one knew what to do with 
as it extended i brought out a line of goods suitable for kings 
and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort with ruffles down
the forehatch and the running gear clewed up with a featherstitch
to leeward and then hauled aft with a back stay and triced up with
a half turn in the standing rigging forward of the weather gaskets 
yes it was a daisy 

but about that time i noticed that the motive power had taken to
standing on one leg and i found that there was something the matter
with the other one so i stocked the business and unloaded taking
sir bors de ganis into camp financially along with certain of his
friends for the works stopped within a year and the good saint
got him to his rest but he had earned it i can say that for him 

when i saw him that first time however his personal condition
will not quite bear description here you can read it in the
lives of the saints 

 all the details concerning the hermits in this chapter are from
lecky but greatly modified this book not being a history but
only a tale the majority of the historians frank details were too
strong for reproduction in it editor 



chapter xxiii

restoration of the fountain

saturday noon i went to the well and looked on a while merlin
was still burning smoke powders and pawing the air and muttering
gibberish as hard as ever but looking pretty down hearted for
of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet 
finally i said 

 how does the thing promise by this time partner 

 behold i am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest
enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands
of the east an it fail me naught can avail peace until i finish 

he raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region and must
have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits for the wind
was their way and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and
billowy fog he poured out volumes of speech to match and contorted
his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary
way at the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting and
about exhausted now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks
and nuns and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of
acres of foundlings all drawn by the prodigious smoke and all
in a grand state of excitement the abbot inquired anxiously for
results merlin said 

 if any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these
waters this which i have but just essayed had done it it has
failed whereby i do now know that that which i had feared is
a truth established the sign of this failure is that the most
potent spirit known to the magicians of the east and whose name
none may utter and live has laid his spell upon this well the
mortal does not breathe nor ever will who can penetrate the secret
of that spell and without that secret none can break it the
water will flow no more forever good father i have done what
man could suffer me to go 

of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation 
he turned to me with the signs of it in his face and said 

 ye have heard him is it true 

 part of it is 

 not all then not all what part is true 

 that that spirit with the russian name has put his spell
upon the well 

 gods wounds then are we ruined 

 possibly 

 but not certainly ye mean not certainly 

 that is it 

 wherefore ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell 

 yes when he says that he says what isnt necessarily true 
there are conditions under which an effort to break it may have
some chance that is some small some trifling chance of success 

 the conditions 

 oh they are nothing difficult only these i want the well
and the surroundings for the space of half a mile entirely to
myself from sunset to day until i remove the ban and nobody
allowed to cross the ground but by my authority 

 are these all 

 yes 

 and you have no fear to try 

 oh none one may fail of course and one may also succeed 
one can try and i am ready to chance it i have my conditions 

 these and all others ye may name i will issue commandment
to that effect 

 wait said merlin with an evil smile ye wit that he that
would break this spell must know that spirits name 

 yes i know his name 

 and wit you also that to know it skills not of itself but ye
must likewise pronounce it ha ha knew ye that 

 yes i knew that too 

 you had that knowledge art a fool are ye minded to utter
that name and die 

 utter it why certainly i would utter it if it was welsh 

 ye are even a dead man then and i go to tell arthur 

 thats all right take your gripsack and get along the thing
for you to do is to go home and work the weather john w merlin 

it was a home shot and it made him wince for he was the worst
weather failure in the kingdom whenever he ordered up the
danger signals along the coast there was a weeks dead calm sure 
and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats 
but i kept him in the weather bureau right along to undermine
his reputation however that shot raised his bile and instead
of starting home to report my death he said he would remain
and enjoy it 

my two experts arrived in the evening and pretty well fagged 
for they had traveled double tides they had pack mules along 
and had brought everything i needed tools pump lead pipe 
greek fire sheaves of big rockets roman candles colored fire
sprays electric apparatus and a lot of sundries everything
necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle they got their
supper and a nap and about midnight we sallied out through a
solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed
the required conditions we took possession of the well and its
surroundings my boys were experts in all sorts of things from
the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical
instrument an hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in
ship shape fashion and the water began to rise then we stowed our
fireworks in the chapel locked up the place and went home to bed 

before the noon mass was over we were at the well again for there
was a deal to do yet and i was determined to spring the miracle
before midnight for business reasons for whereas a miracle
worked for the church on a week day is worth a good deal it is
worth six times as much if you get it in on a sunday in nine hours
the water had risen to its customary level that is to say it was
within twenty three feet of the top we put in a little iron pump 
one of the first turned out by my works near the capital we bored
into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the
well chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long
enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond
the threshold where the gushing water would be visible to the
two hundred and fifty acres of people i was intending should be
present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at
the proper time 

we knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this
hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel where we clamped it down
fast poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the
bottom then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they
could loosely stand all the different breeds of rockets there are 
and they made a portly and imposing sheaf i can tell you we
grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder 
we placed a whole magazine of greek fire on each corner of the
roof blue on one corner green on another red on another and
purple on the last and grounded a wire in each 

about two hundred yards off in the flat we built a pen of
scantlings about four feet high and laid planks on it and so
made a platform we covered it with swell tapestries borrowed
for the occasion and topped it off with the abbots own throne 
when you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race you want
to get in every detail that will count you want to make all the
properties impressive to the public eye you want to make matters
comfortable for your head guest then you can turn yourself loose
and play your effects for all they are worth i know the value of
these things for i know human nature you cant throw too much
style into a miracle it costs trouble and work and sometimes
money but it pays in the end well we brought the wires to
the ground at the chapel and then brought them under the ground
to the platform and hid the batteries there we put a rope fence
a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common
multitude and that finished the work my idea was doors open
at performance to begin at sharp i wished i could
charge admission but of course that wouldnt answer i instructed
my boys to be in the chapel as early as before anybody was
around and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time and
make the fur fly then we went home to supper 

the news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time 
and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had
been pouring into the valley the lower end of the valley was
become one huge camp we should have a good house no question
about that criers went the rounds early in the evening and
announced the coming attempt which put every pulse up to fever
heat they gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would
move in state and occupy the platform at up to which time
all the region which was under my ban must be clear the bells
would then cease from tolling and this sign should be permission
to the multitudes to close in and take their places 

i was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the
abbots solemn procession hove in sight which it did not do till
it was nearly to the rope fence because it was a starless black
night and no torches permitted with it came merlin and took
a front seat on the platform he was as good as his word for once 
one could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban 
but they were there just the same the moment the bells stopped 
those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast
black wave and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow 
and then it solidified itself and you could have walked upon
a pavement of human heads to well miles 

we had a solemn stage wait now for about twenty minutes a thing
i had counted on for effect it is always good to let your audience
have a chance to work up its expectancy at length out of the
silence a noble latin chant mens voices broke and swelled up
and rolled away into the night a majestic tide of melody i had
put that up too and it was one of the best effects i ever invented 
when it was finished i stood up on the platform and extended my
hands abroad for two minutes with my face uplifted that always
produces a dead hush and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word
with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble and
many women to faint 

 constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft 

just as i was moaning out the closing hunks of that word i touched
off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of
people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare it was immense
 that effect lots of people shrieked women curled up and quit
in every direction foundlings collapsed by platoons the abbot
and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered
with agitated prayers merlin held his grip but he was astonished
clear down to his corns he had never seen anything to begin
with that before now was the time to pile in the effects i lifted
my hands and groaned out this word as it were in agony 

 nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen 

 and turned on the red fire you should have heard that atlantic
of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue 
after sixty seconds i shouted 

 transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenen 
tragoedie 

 and lit up the green fire after waiting only forty seconds this
time i spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating
syllables of this word of words 

 mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher 

 and whirled on the purple glare there they were all going
at once red blue green purple four furious volcanoes pouring
vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft and spreading a blinding
rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley in
the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid
against the background of sky his seesaw stopped for the first
time in twenty years i knew the boys were at the pump now and
ready so i said to the abbot 

 the time is come father i am about to pronounce the dread name
and command the spell to dissolve you want to brace up and take
hold of something then i shouted to the people behold in
another minute the spell will be broken or no mortal can break it 
if it break all will know it for you will see the sacred water
gush from the chapel door 

i stood a few moments to let the hearers have a chance to spread
my announcement to those who couldnt hear and so convey it
to the furthest ranks then i made a grand exhibition of extra
posturing and gesturing and shouted 

 lo i command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain
to now disgorge into the skies all the infernal fires that still
remain in him and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence
to the pit there to lie bound a thousand years by his own dread
name i command it bgwjjilligkkk 

then i touched off the hogshead of rockets and a vast fountain of
dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a
hissing rush and burst in mid sky into a storm of flashing jewels 
one mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people
 then suddenly broke into a wild hosannah of joy for there fair
and plain in the uncanny glare they saw the freed water leaping
forth the old abbot could not speak a word for tears and the
chokings in his throat without utterance of any sort he folded me
in his arms and mashed me it was more eloquent than speech 
and harder to get over too in a country where there were really
no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel 

you should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down
in that water and kiss it kiss it and pet it and fondle it and
talk to it as if it were alive and welcome it back with the dear
names they gave their darlings just as if it had been a friend who
was long gone away and lost and was come home again yes it was
pretty to see and made me think more of them than i had done before 

i sent merlin home on a shutter he had caved in and gone down
like a landslide when i pronounced that fearful name and had
never come to since he never had heard that name before neither
had i but to him it was the right one any jumble would have
been the right one he admitted afterward that that spirits own
mother could not have pronounced that name better than i did 
he never could understand how i survived it and i didnt tell
him it is only young magicians that give away a secret like that 
merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out
the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it 
but he didnt arrive 

when i started to the chapel the populace uncovered and fell back
reverently to make a wide way for me as if i had been some kind
of a superior being and i was i was aware of that i took along
a night shift of monks and taught them the mystery of the pump 
and set them to work for it was plain that a good part of the
people out there were going to sit up with the water all night 
consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted
of it to those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle
itself and they were full of wonder over it and of admiration 
too of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance 

it was a great night an immense night there was reputation in it 
i could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it 



chapter xxiv

a rival magician

my influence in the valley of holiness was something prodigious
now it seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable
account the thought came to me the next morning and was suggested
by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come
riding in according to history the monks of this place two
centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash 
it might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still
remaining so i sounded a brother 

 wouldnt you like a bath 

he shuddered at the thought the thought of the peril of it to
the well but he said with feeling 

 one needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that
blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy would god i might
wash me but it may not be fair sir tempt me not it is forbidden 

and then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that i was resolved
he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed 
if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile so i
went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this brother he
blenched at the idea i dont mean that you could see him blench 
for of course you couldnt see it without you scraped him and
i didnt care enough about it to scrape him but i knew the blench
was there just the same and within a book covers thickness of
the surface too blenched and trembled he said 

 ah son ask aught else thou wilt and it is thine and freely
granted out of a grateful heart but this oh this would you
drive away the blessed water again 

 no father i will not drive it away i have mysterious knowledge
which teaches me that there was an error that other time when
it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain 
a large interest began to show up in the old mans face my
knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune 
which was caused by quite another sort of sin 

 these are brave words but but right welcome if they be true 

 they are true indeed let me build the bath again father 
let me build it again and the fountain shall flow forever 

 you promise this you promise it say the word say you promise it 

 i do promise it 

 then will i have the first bath myself go get ye to your work 
tarry not tarry not but go 

i and my boys were at work straight off the ruins of the old
bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery not a stone
missing they had been left just so all these lifetimes and
avoided with a pious fear as things accursed in two days we
had it all done and the water in a spacious pool of clear pure
water that a body could swim in it was running water too 
it came in and went out through the ancient pipes the old abbot
kept his word and was the first to try it he went down black
and shaky leaving the whole black community above troubled and
worried and full of bodings but he came back white and joyful 
and the game was made another triumph scored 

it was a good campaign that we made in that valley of holiness 
and i was very well satisfied and ready to move on now but
i struck a disappointment i caught a heavy cold and it started
up an old lurking rheumatism of mine of course the rheumatism
hunted up my weakest place and located itself there this was
the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me what
time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace 

when at last i got out i was a shadow but everybody was full
of attentions and kindnesses and these brought cheer back into
my life and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly
up toward health and strength again so i gained fast 

sandy was worn out with nursing so i made up my mind to turn out
and go a cruise alone leaving her at the nunnery to rest up 
my idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree
and wander through the country a week or two on foot this would
give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest
class of free citizens on equal terms there was no other way
to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation
of the laws upon it if i went among them as a gentleman there
would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out
from their private joys and troubles and i should get no further
than the outside shell 

one morning i was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip 
and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity
of the valley when i came upon an artificial opening in the face
of a low precipice and recognized it by its location as a hermitage
which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den
of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity i knew he had
lately been offered a situation in the great sahara where lions
and sandflies made the hermit life peculiarly attractive and
difficult and had gone to africa to take possession so i thought
i would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed
with its reputation 

my surprise was great the place was newly swept and scoured 
then there was another surprise back in the gloom of the cavern
i heard the clink of a little bell and then this exclamation 

 hello central is this you camelot behold thou mayst glad
thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that
it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in
impossible places here standeth in the flesh his mightiness
the boss and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak 

now what a radical reversal of things this was what a jumbling
together of extravagant incongruities what a fantastic conjunction
of opposites and irreconcilables the home of the bogus miracle
become the home of a real one the den of a mediaeval hermit turned
into a telephone office 

the telephone clerk stepped into the light and i recognized one
of my young fellows i said 

 how long has this office been established here ulfius 

 but since midnight fair sir boss an it please you we saw many
lights in the valley and so judged it well to make a station 
for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town
of goodly size 

 quite right it isnt a town in the customary sense but its
a good stand anyway do you know where you are 

 of that i have had no time to make inquiry for whenas my
comradeship moved hence upon their labors leaving me in charge 
i got me to needed rest purposing to inquire when i waked and
report the places name to camelot for record 

 well this is the valley of holiness 

it didnt take i mean he didnt start at the name as i had
supposed he would he merely said 

 i will so report it 

 why the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late
wonders that have happened here you didnt hear of them 

 ah ye will remember we move by night and avoid speech with all 
we learn naught but that we get by the telephone from camelot 

 why they know all about this thing havent they told you anything
about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain 

 oh that indeed yes but the name of this valley doth woundily
differ from the name of that one indeed to differ wider were not pos 

 what was that name then 

 the valley of hellishness 

 that explains it confound a telephone anyway it is the very
demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of
divergence from similarity of sense but no matter you know
the name of the place now call up camelot 

he did it and had clarence sent for it was good to hear my boys
voice again it was like being home after some affectionate
interchanges and some account of my late illness i said 

 what is new 

 the king and queen and many of the court do start even in this
hour to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye
have restored and cleanse themselves of sin and see the place
where the infernal spirit spouted true hell flames to the clouds
 an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise
smile a smile sith twas i that made selection of those flames
from out our stock and sent them by your order 

 does the king know the way to this place 

 the king no nor to any other in his realms mayhap but the lads
that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way 
and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night 

 this will bring them here when 

 mid afternoon or later the third day 

 anything else in the way of news 

 the king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested
to him one regiment is complete and officered 

 the mischief i wanted a main hand in that myself there is
only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer
a regular army 

 yes and now ye will marvel to know theres not so much as one
west pointer in that regiment 

 what are you talking about are you in earnest 

 it is truly as i have said 

 why this makes me uneasy who were chosen and what was the
method competitive examination 

 indeed i know naught of the method i but know this these
officers be all of noble family and are born what is it you
call it chuckleheads 

 theres something wrong clarence 

 comfort yourself then for two candidates for a lieutenancy do
travel hence with the king young nobles both and if you but wait
where you are you will hear them questioned 

 that is news to the purpose i will get one west pointer in 
anyway mount a man and send him to that school with a message 
let him kill horses if necessary but he must be there before
sunset to night and say 

 there is no need i have laid a ground wire to the school 
prithee let me connect you with it 

it sounded good in this atmosphere of telephones and lightning
communication with distant regions i was breathing the breath
of life again after long suffocation i realized then what a
creepy dull inanimate horror this land had been to me all these
years and how i had been in such a stifled condition of mind as
to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it 

i gave my order to the superintendent of the academy personally 
i also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and
a box or so of safety matches i was getting tired of doing
without these conveniences i could have them now as i wasnt
going to wear armor any more at present and therefore could get
at my pockets 

when i got back to the monastery i found a thing of interest
going on the abbot and his monks were assembled in the great
hall observing with childish wonder and faith the performances
of a new magician a fresh arrival his dress was the extreme of
the fantastic as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an indian
medicine man wears he was mowing and mumbling and gesticulating 
and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor the
regular thing you know he was a celebrity from asia so he
said and that was enough that sort of evidence was as good
as gold and passed current everywhere 

how easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellows
terms his specialty was to tell you what any individual on the
face of the globe was doing at the moment and what he had done
at any time in the past and what he would do at any time in the
future he asked if any would like to know what the emperor of
the east was doing now the sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing
of hands made eloquent answer this reverend crowd would like to
know what that monarch was at just as this moment the fraud
went through some more mummery and then made grave announcement 

 the high and mighty emperor of the east doth at this moment put
money in the palm of a holy begging friar one two three pieces 
and they be all of silver 

a buzz of admiring exclamations broke out all around 

 it is marvelous wonderful what study what labor to have
acquired a so amazing power as this 

would they like to know what the supreme lord of inde was doing 
yes he told them what the supreme lord of inde was doing then
he told them what the sultan of egypt was at also what the king
of the remote seas was about and so on and so on and with each
new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher 
they thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time 
but no he never had to hesitate he always knew and always with
unerring precision i saw that if this thing went on i should lose
my supremacy this fellow would capture my following i should
be left out in the cold i must put a cog in his wheel and do it
right away too i said 

 if i might ask i should very greatly like to know what a certain
person is doing 

 speak and freely i will tell you 

 it will be difficult perhaps impossible 

 my art knoweth not that word the more difficult it is the more
certainly will i reveal it to you 

you see i was working up the interest it was getting pretty
high too you could see that by the craning necks all around 
and the half suspended breathing so now i climaxed it 

 if you make no mistake if you tell me truly what i want to
know i will give you two hundred silver pennies 

 the fortune is mine i will tell you what you would know 

 then tell me what i am doing with my right hand 

 ah h there was a general gasp of surprise it had not occurred
to anybody in the crowd that simple trick of inquiring about
somebody who wasnt ten thousand miles away the magician was
hit hard it was an emergency that had never happened in his
experience before and it corked him he didnt know how to meet
it he looked stunned confused he couldnt say a word come 
i said what are you waiting for is it possible you can answer up 
right off and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is
doing and yet cant tell what a person is doing who isnt three
yards from you persons behind me know what i am doing with my
right hand they will indorse you if you tell correctly he was
still dumb very well ill tell you why you dont speak up and
tell it is because you dont know you a magician good friends 
this tramp is a mere fraud and liar 

this distressed the monks and terrified them they were not used
to hearing these awful beings called names and they did not know
what might be the consequence there was a dead silence now 
superstitious bodings were in every mind the magician began to
pull his wits together and when he presently smiled an easy 
nonchalant smile it spread a mighty relief around for it indicated
that his mood was not destructive he said 

 it hath struck me speechless the frivolity of this persons
speech let all know if perchance there be any who know it not 
that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with
the doings of any but kings princes emperors them that be born
in the purple and them only had ye asked me what arthur the great
king is doing it were another matter and i had told ye but the
doings of a subject interest me not 

 oh i misunderstood you i thought you said anybody and so
i supposed anybody included well anybody that is everybody 

 it doth anybody that is of lofty birth and the better if
he be royal 

 that it meseemeth might well be said the abbot who saw his
opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster for it were not
likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for
the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be
born near to the summits of greatness our arthur the king 

 would you know of him broke in the enchanter 

 most gladly yea and gratefully 

everybody was full of awe and interest again right away the
incorrigible idiots they watched the incantations absorbingly 
and looked at me with a there now what can you say to that 
air when the announcement came 

 the king is weary with the chase and lieth in his palace these
two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep 

 gods benison upon him said the abbot and crossed himself 
 may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul 

 and so it might be if he were sleeping i said but the king
is not sleeping the king rides 

here was trouble again a conflict of authority nobody knew which
of us to believe i still had some reputation left the magicians
scorn was stirred and he said 

 lo i have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and
magicians in my life days but none before that could sit idle and
see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help 

 you have lived in the woods and lost much by it i use incantations
myself as this good brotherhood are aware but only on occasions
of moment 

when it comes to sarcasming i reckon i know how to keep my end up 
that jab made this fellow squirm the abbot inquired after the
queen and the court and got this information 

 they be all on sleep being overcome by fatigue like as to the king 

i said 

 that is merely another lie half of them are about their amusements 
the queen and the other half are not sleeping they ride now
perhaps you can spread yourself a little and tell us where the king
and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going 

 they sleep now as i said but on the morrow they will ride 
for they go a journey toward the sea 

 and where will they be the day after to morrow at vespers 

 far to the north of camelot and half their journey will be done 

 that is another lie by the space of a hundred and fifty miles 
their journey will not be merely half done it will be all done 
and they will be here in this valley 

 that was a noble shot it set the abbot and the monks in a whirl
of excitement and it rocked the enchanter to his base i followed
the thing right up 

 if the king does not arrive i will have myself ridden on a rail 
if he does i will ride you on a rail instead 

next day i went up to the telephone office and found that the king
had passed through two towns that were on the line i spotted
his progress on the succeeding day in the same way i kept these
matters to myself the third days reports showed that if he
kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon there
was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming there seemed
to be no preparations making to receive him in state a strange
thing truly only one thing could explain this that other
magician had been cutting under me sure this was true i asked
a friend of mine a monk about it and he said yes the magician
had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court
had concluded to make no journey at all but stay at home think
of that observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country 
these people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in
history and the only one within their memory that had a positive
value and yet here they were ready to take up with an adventurer
who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word 

however it was not good politics to let the king come without
any fuss and feathers at all so i went down and drummed up a
procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and
started them out at two oclock to meet him and that was the
sort of state he arrived in the abbot was helpless with rage
and humiliation when i brought him out on a balcony and showed
him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to
offer him welcome and no stir of life or clang of joy bell to glad
his spirit he took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces 
the next minute the bells were dinning furiously and the various
buildings were vomiting monks and nuns who went swarming in a
rush toward the coming procession and with them went that magician
 and he was on a rail too by the abbots order and his reputation
was in the mud and mine was in the sky again yes a man can
keep his trademark current in such a country but he cant sit
around and do it he has got to be on deck and attending to business
right along 



chapter xxv

a competitive examination

when the king traveled for change of air or made a progress or
visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost
of his keep part of the administration moved with him it was
a fashion of the time the commission charged with the examination
of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the
valley whereas they could have transacted their business just
as well at home and although this expedition was strictly a
holiday excursion for the king he kept some of his business
functions going just the same he touched for the evil as usual 
he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases for he was
himself chief justice of the kings bench 

he shone very well in this latter office he was a wise and humane
judge and he clearly did his honest best and fairest according
to his lights that is a large reservation his lights i mean
his rearing often colored his decisions whenever there was a
dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree 
the kings leanings and sympathies were for the former class always 
whether he suspected it or not it was impossible that this should
be otherwise the blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholders
moral perceptions are known and conceded the world over and a
privileged class an aristocracy is but a band of slaveholders
under another name this has a harsh sound and yet should not
be offensive to any even to the noble himself unless the fact
itself be an offense for the statement simply formulates a fact 
the repulsive feature of slavery is the thing not its name one
needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below
him to recognize and in but indifferently modified measure
 the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder and behind these
are the slaveholders spirit the slaveholders blunted feeling 
they are the result of the same cause in both cases the possessors
old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being 
the kings judgments wrought frequent injustices but it was merely
the fault of his training his natural and unalterable sympathies 
he was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother
for the position of milk distributor to starving children in
famine time her own children would fare a shade better than the rest 

one very curious case came before the king a young girl an
orphan who had a considerable estate married a fine young fellow
who had nothing the girls property was within a seigniory held
by the church the bishop of the diocese an arrogant scion of
the great nobility claimed the girls estate on the ground that
she had married privately and thus had cheated the church out
of one of its rights as lord of the seigniory the one heretofore
referred to as le droit du seigneur the penalty of refusal or
avoidance was confiscation the girls defense was that the
lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop and the
particular right here involved was not transferable but must be
exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated and that an older
law of the church itself strictly barred the bishop from exercising
it it was a very odd case indeed 

it reminded me of something i had read in my youth about the
ingenious way in which the aldermen of london raised the money
that built the mansion house a person who had not taken the
sacrament according to the anglican rite could not stand as a
candidate for sheriff of london thus dissenters were ineligible 
they could not run if asked they could not serve if elected 
the aldermen who without any question were yankees in disguise 
hit upon this neat device they passed a by law imposing a fine
of l upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for
sheriff and a fine of l upon any person who after being
elected sheriff refused to serve then they went to work and
elected a lot of dissenters one after another and kept it up
until they had collected l in fines and there stands the
stately mansion house to this day to keep the blushing citizen
in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of yankees
slipped into london and played games of the sort that has given
their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good
and holy peoples that be in the earth 

the girls case seemed strong to me the bishops case was just
as strong i did not see how the king was going to get out of
this hole but he got out i append his decision 

 truly i find small difficulty here the matter being even a
childs affair for simpleness an the young bride had conveyed
notice as in duty bound to her feudal lord and proper master
and protector the bishop she had suffered no loss for the said
bishop could have got a dispensation making him for temporary
conveniency eligible to the exercise of his said right and thus
would she have kept all she had whereas failing in her first
duty she hath by that failure failed in all for whoso clinging
to a rope severeth it above his hands must fall it being no
defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound neither any
deliverance from his peril as he shall find pardy the womans
case is rotten at the source it is the decree of the court that
she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods even to the
last farthing that she doth possess and be thereto mulcted in
the costs next 

here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months
old poor young creatures they had lived these three months
lapped to the lips in worldly comforts these clothes and trinkets
they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch
of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree and in
these pretty clothes she crying on his shoulder and he trying
to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair 
they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless 
bedless breadless why the very beggars by the roadsides were
not so poor as they 

well the king was out of the hole and on terms satisfactory to
the church and the rest of the aristocracy no doubt men write
many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy but
the fact remains that where every man in a state has a vote brutal
laws are impossible arthurs people were of course poor material
for a republic because they had been debased so long by monarchy 
and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short
work of that law which the king had just been administering if it
had been submitted to their full and free vote there is a phrase
which has grown so common in the worlds mouth that it has come
to seem to have sense and meaning the sense and meaning implied
when it is used that is the phrase which refers to this or that or
the other nation as possibly being capable of self government 
and the implied sense of it is that there has been a nation
somewhere some time or other which wasnt capable of it wasnt as
able to govern itself as some self appointed specialists were or
would be to govern it the master minds of all nations in all
ages have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation 
and from the mass of the nation only not from its privileged
classes and so no matter what the nations intellectual grade
was whether high or low the bulk of its ability was in the long
ranks of its nameless and its poor and so it never saw the day
that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself 
which is to assert an always self proven fact that even the best
governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still
behind the best condition attainable by its people and that the
same is true of kindred governments of lower grades all the way
down to the lowest 

king arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond
my calculations i had not supposed he would move in the matter
while i was away and so i had not mapped out a scheme for determining
the merits of officers i had only remarked that it would be wise
to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination 
and privately i meant to put together a list of military qualifications
that nobody could answer to but my west pointers that ought
to have been attended to before i left for the king was so taken
with the idea of a standing army that he couldnt wait but must
get about it at once and get up as good a scheme of examination
as he could invent out of his own head 

i was impatient to see what this was and to show too how much
more admirable was the one which i should display to the examining
board i intimated this gently to the king and it fired his
curiosity when the board was assembled i followed him in and
behind us came the candidates one of these candidates was a bright
young west pointer of mine and with him were a couple of my
west point professors 

when i saw the board i did not know whether to cry or to laugh 
the head of it was the officer known to later centuries as norroy
king at arms the two other members were chiefs of bureaus in
his department and all three were priests of course all officials
who had to know how to read and write were priests 

my candidate was called first out of courtesy to me and the head
of the board opened on him with official solemnity 

 name 

 mal ease 

 son of 

 webster 

 webster webster hm i my memory faileth to recall the
name condition 

 weaver 

 weaver god keep us 

the king was staggered from his summit to his foundations one
clerk fainted and the others came near it the chairman pulled
himself together and said indignantly 

 it is sufficient get you hence 

but i appealed to the king i begged that my candidate might be
examined the king was willing but the board who were all
well born folk implored the king to spare them the indignity of
examining the weavers son i knew they didnt know enough to
examine him anyway so i joined my prayers to theirs and the king
turned the duty over to my professors i had had a blackboard
prepared and it was put up now and the circus began it was
beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war and wallow
in details of battle and siege of supply transportation mining
and countermining grand tactics big strategy and little strategy 
signal service infantry cavalry artillery and all about siege
guns field guns gatling guns rifled guns smooth bores musket
practice revolver practice and not a solitary word of it all
could these catfish make head or tail of you understand and it
was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares on the
blackboard that would stump the angels themselves and do it like
nothing too all about eclipses and comets and solstices and
constellations and mean time and sidereal time and dinner time 
and bedtime and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or
under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make
him wish he hadnt come and when the boy made his military salute
and stood aside at last i was proud enough to hug him and all
those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified 
partly drunk and wholly caught out and snowed under i judged
that the cake was ours and by a large majority 

education is a great thing this was the same youth who had come
to west point so ignorant that when i asked him if a general
officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle 
what ought he to do answered up naively and said 

 get up and brush himself 

one of the young nobles was called up now i thought i would
question him a little myself i said 

 can your lordship read 

his face flushed indignantly and he fired this at me 

 takest me for a clerk i trow i am not of a blood that 

 answer the question 

he crowded his wrath down and made out to answer no 

 can you write 

he wanted to resent this too but i said 

 you will confine yourself to the questions and make no comments 
you are not here to air your blood or your graces and nothing
of the sort will be permitted can you write 

 no 

 do you know the multiplication table 

 i wit not what ye refer to 

 how much is times 

 it is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency
requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my life days occurred 
and so not having no need to know this thing i abide barren
of the knowledge 

 if a trade a barrel of onions to b worth pence the bushel 
in exchange for a sheep worth pence and a dog worth a penny 
and c kill the dog before delivery because bitten by the same 
who mistook him for d what sum is still due to a from b and
which party pays for the dog c or d and who gets the money 
if a is the penny sufficient or may he claim consequential damages
in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit
which might have inured from the dog and classifiable as earned
increment that is to say usufruct 

 verily in the all wise and unknowable providence of god who
moveth in mysterious ways his wonders to perform have i never
heard the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and
congestion of the ducts of thought wherefore i beseech you let
the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless
names work out their several salvations from their piteous and
wonderful difficulties without help of mine for indeed their
trouble is sufficient as it is whereas an i tried to help i should
but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself
to see the desolation wrought 

 what do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation 

 if there be such mayhap his grace the king did promulgate them
whilst that i lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby
failed to hear his proclamation 

 what do you know of the science of optics 

 i know of governors of places and seneschals of castles and
sheriffs of counties and many like small offices and titles of
honor but him you call the science of optics i have not heard
of before peradventure it is a new dignity 

 yes in this country 

try to conceive of this mollusk gravely applying for an official
position of any kind under the sun why he had all the earmarks
of a typewriter copyist if you leave out the disposition to
contribute uninvited emendations of your grammar and punctuation 
it was unaccountable that he didnt attempt a little help of that
sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job but that
didnt prove that he hadnt material in him for the disposition 
it only proved that he wasnt a typewriter copyist yet after
nagging him a little more i let the professors loose on him and
they turned him inside out on the line of scientific war and
found him empty of course he knew somewhat about the warfare
of the time bushwhacking around for ogres and bull fights in
the tournament ring and such things but otherwise he was empty
and useless then we took the other young noble in hand and he
was the first ones twin for ignorance and incapacity i delivered
them into the hands of the chairman of the board with the comfortable
consciousness that their cake was dough they were examined in
the previous order of precedence 

 name so please you 

 pertipole son of sir pertipole baron of barley mash 

 grandfather 

 also sir pertipole baron of barley mash 

 great grandfather 

 the same name and title 

 great great grandfather 

 we had none worshipful sir the line failing before it had
reached so far back 

 it mattereth not it is a good four generations and fulfilleth
the requirements of the rule 

 fulfills what rule i asked 

 the rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the
candidate is not eligible 

 a man not eligible for a lieutenancy in the army unless he can
prove four generations of noble descent 

 even so neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be commissioned
without that qualification 

 oh come this is an astonishing thing what good is such a
qualification as that 

 what good it is a hardy question fair sir and boss since it doth
go far to impugn the wisdom of even our holy mother church herself 

 as how 

 for that she hath established the self same rule regarding
saints by her law none may be canonized until he hath lain dead
four generations 

 i see i see it is the same thing it is wonderful in the one
case a man lies dead alive four generations mummified in ignorance
and sloth and that qualifies him to command live people and take
their weal and woe into his impotent hands and in the other case 
a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations and that
qualifies him for office in the celestial camp does the kings
grace approve of this strange law 

the king said 

 why truly i see naught about it that is strange all places of
honor and of profit do belong by natural right to them that be
of noble blood and so these dignities in the army are their
property and would be so without this or any rule the rule is
but to mark a limit its purpose is to keep out too recent blood 
which would bring into contempt these offices and men of lofty
lineage would turn their backs and scorn to take them i were
to blame an i permitted this calamity you can permit it an you
are minded so to do for you have the delegated authority but
that the king should do it were a most strange madness and not
comprehensible to any 

 i yield proceed sir chief of the heralds college 

the chairman resumed as follows 

 by what illustrious achievement for the honor of the throne and
state did the founder of your great line lift himself to the
sacred dignity of the british nobility 

 he built a brewery 

 sire the board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements
and qualifications for military command and doth hold his case
open for decision after due examination of his competitor 

the competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations
of nobility himself so there was a tie in military qualifications
that far 

he stood aside a moment and sir pertipole was questioned further 

 of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line 

 she came of the highest landed gentry yet she was not noble 
she was gracious and pure and charitable of a blameless life and
character insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the
best lady in the land 

 that will do stand down he called up the competing lordling
again and asked what was the rank and condition of the
great grandmother who conferred british nobility upon your
great house 

 she was a kings leman and did climb to that splendid eminence
by her own unholpen merit from the sewer where she was born 

 ah this indeed is true nobility this is the right and perfect
intermixture the lieutenancy is yours fair lord hold it not in
contempt it is the humble step which will lead to grandeurs more
worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine 

i was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation i had promised
myself an easy and zenith scouring triumph and this was the outcome 

i was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the
face i told him to go home and be patient this wasnt the end 

i had a private audience with the king and made a proposition 
i said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities 
and he couldnt have done a wiser thing it would also be a good
idea to add five hundred officers to it in fact add as many
officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the
country even if there should finally be five times as many officers
as privates in it and thus make it the crack regiment the envied
regiment the kings own regiment and entitled to fight on its
own hook and in its own way and go whither it would and come
when it pleased in time of war and be utterly swell and independent 
this would make that regiment the hearts desire of all the
nobility and they would all be satisfied and happy then we
would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace
materials and officer it with nobodies as was proper nobodies
selected on a basis of mere efficiency and we would make this
regiment toe the line allow it no aristocratic freedom from
restraint and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering 
to the end that whenever the kings own was tired and wanted to go
off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good
time it could go without uneasiness knowing that matters were in
safe hands behind it and business going to be continued at the
old stand same as usual the king was charmed with the idea 

when i noticed that it gave me a valuable notion i thought
i saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last you
see the royalties of the pendragon stock were a long lived race
and very fruitful whenever a child was born to any of these
 and it was pretty often there was wild joy in the nations mouth 
and piteous sorrow in the nations heart the joy was questionable 
but the grief was honest because the event meant another call
for a royal grant long was the list of these royalties and
they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury
and a menace to the crown yet arthur could not believe this
latter fact and he would not listen to any of my various projects
for substituting something in the place of the royal grants if i
could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for
one of these outlying scions from his own pocket i could have
made a grand to do over it and it would have had a good effect
with the nation but no he wouldnt hear of such a thing he had
something like a religious passion for royal grant he seemed to
look upon it as a sort of sacred swag and one could not irritate
him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that
venerable institution if i ventured to cautiously hint that there
was not another respectable family in england that would humble
itself to hold out the hat however that is as far as i ever got 
he always cut me short there and peremptorily too 

but i believed i saw my chance at last i would form this crack
regiment out of officers alone not a single private half of it
should consist of nobles who should fill all the places up to
major general and serve gratis and pay their own expenses and
they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest
of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood 
these princes of the blood should range in rank from lieutenant general
up to field marshal and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and
fed by the state moreover and this was the master stroke
 it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always
addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe compelling title which
i would presently invent and they and they only in all england
should be so addressed finally all princes of the blood should
have free choice join that regiment get that great title and
renounce the royal grant or stay out and receive a grant neatest
touch of all unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be
 born into the regiment and start fair with good wages and a
permanent situation upon due notice from the parents 

all the boys would join i was sure of that so all existing
grants would be relinquished that the newly born would always
join was equally certain within sixty days that quaint and
bizarre anomaly the royal grant would cease to be a living fact 
and take its place among the curiosities of the past 



chapter xxvi

the first newspaper

when i told the king i was going out disguised as a petty freeman
to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life
of the people he was all afire with the novelty of the thing
in a minute and was bound to take a chance in the adventure
himself nothing should stop him he would drop everything and
go along it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many
a day he wanted to glide out the back way and start at once 
but i showed him that that wouldnt answer you see he was billed
for the kings evil to touch for it i mean and it wouldnt be
right to disappoint the house and it wouldnt make a delay worth
considering anyway it was only a one night stand and i thought
he ought to tell the queen he was going away he clouded up at
that and looked sad i was sorry i had spoken especially when
he said mournfully 

 thou forgettest that launcelot is here and where launcelot is 
she noteth not the going forth of the king nor what day he returneth 

of course i changed the subject yes guenever was beautiful 
it is true but take her all around she was pretty slack i never
meddled in these matters they werent my affair but i did hate
to see the way things were going on and i dont mind saying that
much manys the time she had asked me sir boss hast seen
sir launcelot about but if ever she went fretting around for
the king i didnt happen to be around at the time 

there was a very good lay out for the kings evil business very
tidy and creditable the king sat under a canopy of state about
him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals 
conspicuous both for location and personal outfit stood marinel 
a hermit of the quack doctor species to introduce the sick all
abroad over the spacious floor and clear down to the doors 
in a thick jumble lay or sat the scrofulous under a strong light 
it was as good as a tableau in fact it had all the look of being
gotten up for that though it wasnt there were eight hundred
sick people present the work was slow it lacked the interest
of novelty for me because i had seen the ceremonies before 
the thing soon became tedious but the proprieties required me
to stick it out the doctor was there for the reason that in all
such crowds there were many people who only imagined something
was the matter with them and many who were consciously sound
but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king and
yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of
coin that went with the touch up to this time this coin had been
a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar when you
consider how much that amount of money would buy in that age
and country and how usual it was to be scrofulous when not dead 
you would understand that the annual kings evil appropriation was
just the river and harbor bill of that government for the grip it
took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the
surplus so i had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself
for the kings evil i covered six sevenths of the appropriation
into the treasury a week before starting from camelot on my
adventures and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into
five cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk
of the kings evil department a nickel to take the place of each
gold coin you see and do its work for it it might strain the
nickel some but i judged it could stand it as a rule i do not
approve of watering stock but i considered it square enough
in this case for it was just a gift anyway of course you can
water a gift as much as you want to and i generally do the old
gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown
origin as a rule but some of them were roman they were ill shapen 
and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full they
were hammered not minted and they were so worn with use that
the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters and looked
like them i judged that a sharp bright new nickel with a
first rate likeness of the king on one side of it and guenever
on the other and a blooming pious motto would take the tuck out
of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous
fancy more and i was right this batch was the first it was
tried on and it worked to a charm the saving in expense was
a notable economy you will see that by these figures we touched
a trifle over of the patients at former rates this would
have cost the government about at the new rate we pulled
through for about thus saving upward of at one swoop 
to appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke consider these
other figures the annual expenses of a national government amount
to the equivalent of a contribution of three days average wages of
every individual of the population counting every individual as
if he were a man if you take a nation of where average
wages are per day three days wages taken from each individual
will provide and pay the governments expenses in my
day in my own country this money was collected from imposts 
and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it and it
made him comfortable to think so whereas in fact it was paid
by the american people and was so equally and exactly distributed
among them that the annual cost to the millionaire and the
annual cost to the sucking child of the day laborer was precisely
the same each paid nothing could be equaler than that 
i reckon well scotland and ireland were tributary to arthur 
and the united populations of the british islands amounted to
something less than a mechanics average wage was
 cents a day when he paid his own keep by this rule the national
governments expenses were a year or about a day 
thus by the substitution of nickels for gold on a kings evil
day i not only injured no one dissatisfied no one but pleased
all concerned and saved four fifths of that days national expense
into the bargain a saving which would have been the equivalent
of in my day in america in making this substitution
i had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source the wisdom
of my boyhood for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom 
howsoever lowly may be its origin in my boyhood i had always
saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary
cause the buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as
the coin the coin would answer me better than the buttons all
hands were happy and nobody hurt 

marinel took the patients as they came he examined the candidate 
if he couldnt qualify he was warned off if he could he was passed
along to the king a priest pronounced the words they shall
lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover then the king
stroked the ulcers while the reading continued finally the
patient graduated and got his nickel the king hanging it around
his neck himself and was dismissed would you think that that
would cure it certainly did any mummery will cure if the
patients faith is strong in it up by astolat there was a chapel
where the virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd
geese around there the girl said so herself and they built the
chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the
occurrence a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick
person to approach whereas on the contrary thousands of the lame
and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away
whole and sound and even the well could look upon it and live 
of course when i was told these things i did not believe them 
but when i went there and saw them i had to succumb i saw the
cures effected myself and they were real cures and not questionable 
i saw cripples whom i had seen around camelot for years on crutches 
arrive and pray before that picture and put down their crutches
and walk off without a limp there were piles of crutches there
which had been left by such people as a testimony 

in other places people operated on a patients mind without saying
a word to him and cured him in others experts assembled patients
in a room and prayed over them and appealed to their faith and
those patients went away cured wherever you find a king who cant
cure the kings evil you can be sure that the most valuable
superstition that supports his throne the subjects belief in
the divine appointment of his sovereign has passed away in my
youth the monarchs of england had ceased to touch for the evil 
but there was no occasion for this diffidence they could have
cured it forty nine times in fifty 

well when the priest had been droning for three hours and the
good king polishing the evidences and the sick were still pressing
forward as plenty as ever i got to feeling intolerably bored 
i was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state 
for the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his
repulsivenesses stroked again those words were being droned out 
 they shall lay their hands on the sick when outside there rang
clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled
thirteen worthless centuries about my ears camelot weekly
hosannah and literary volcano latest irruption only two cents
 all about the big miracle in the valley of holiness one greater
than kings had arrived the newsboy but i was the only person
in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth and
what this imperial magician was come into the world to do 

i dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper the
adam newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change 
is around the corner yet it was delicious to see a newspaper
again yet i was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon
the first batch of display head lines i had lived in a clammy
atmosphere of reverence respect deference so long that they
sent a quivery little cold wave through me

 and so on and so on yes it was too loud once i could have
enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it but now its
note was discordant it was good arkansas journalism but this
was not arkansas moreover the next to the last line was calculated
to give offense to the hermits and perhaps lose us their advertising 
indeed there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through
the paper it was plain i had undergone a considerable change
without noticing it i found myself unpleasantly affected by
pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and
airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life there was an
abundance of the following breed of items and they discomforted me

of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning i knew
that quite well and yet it was somehow disappointing the
 court circular pleased me better indeed its simple and dignified
respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those
disgraceful familiarities but even it could have been improved 
do what one may there is no getting an air of variety into a court
circular i acknowledge that there is a profound monotonousness
about its facts that baffles and defeats ones sincerest efforts
to make them sparkle and enthuse the best way to manage in fact 
the only sensible way is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under
variety of form skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle
of words it deceives the eye you think it is a new fact it
gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything 
this excites you and you drain the whole column with a good
appetite and perhaps never notice that its a barrel of soup made
out of a single bean clarences way was good it was simple 
it was dignified it was direct and business like all i say is 
it was not the best way

however take the paper by and large i was vastly pleased with it 
little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and
there but there were not enough of them to amount to anything 
and it was good enough arkansas proof reading anyhow and better
than was needed in arthurs day and realm as a rule the grammar
was leaky and the construction more or less lame but i did not
much mind these things they are common defects of my own and
one mustnt criticise other people on grounds where he cant stand
perpendicular himself 

i was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole
paper at this one meal but i got only a few bites and then had
to postpone because the monks around me besieged me so with eager
questions what is this curious thing what is it for is it a
handkerchief saddle blanket part of a shirt what is it made of 
how thin it is and how dainty and frail and how it rattles 
will it wear do you think and wont the rain injure it is it
writing that appears on it or is it only ornamentation they
suspected it was writing because those among them who knew how
to read latin and had a smattering of greek recognized some of
the letters but they could make nothing out of the result as a
whole i put my information in the simplest form i could 

 it is a public journal i will explain what that is another time 
it is not cloth it is made of paper some time i will explain
what paper is the lines on it are reading matter and not written
by hand but printed by and by i will explain what printing is 
a thousand of these sheets have been made all exactly like this 
in every minute detail they cant be told apart then they all
broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration 

 a thousand verily a mighty work a years work for many men 

 no merely a days work for a man and a boy 

they crossed themselves and whiffed out a protective prayer or two 

 ah h a miracle a wonder dark work of enchantment 

i let it go at that then i read in a low voice to as many as
could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance part of
the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well and
was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through 
 ah h h how true amazing amazing these be the very
haps as they happened in marvelous exactness and might they
take this strange thing in their hands and feel of it and examine
it they would be very careful yes so they took it handling
it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing
come from some supernatural region and gently felt of its texture 
caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch and
scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes these
grouped bent heads these charmed faces these speaking eyes
 how beautiful to me for was not this my darling and was not
all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent
tribute and unforced compliment to it i knew then how a mother
feels when women whether strangers or friends take her new baby 
and close themselves about it with one eager impulse and bend
their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest
of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it
were not for that time i knew how she feels and that there is
no other satisfied ambition whether of king conqueror or poet 
that ever reaches half way to that serene far summit or yields half
so divine a contentment 

during all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to
group all up and down and about that huge hall and my happy eye
was upon it always and i sat motionless steeped in satisfaction 
drunk with enjoyment yes this was heaven i was tasting it once 
if i might never taste it more 



chapter xxvii

the yankee and the king travel incognito

about bedtime i took the king to my private quarters to cut his
hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear 
the high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but
hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around whereas the
lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both the slaves
were bangless and allowed their hair free growth so i inverted
a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it 
i also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only
about a half inch long and tried to do it inartistically and
succeeded it was a villainous disfigurement when he got his
lubberly sandals on and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth 
which hung straight from his neck to his ankle bones he was no
longer the comeliest man in his kingdom but one of the unhandsomest
and most commonplace and unattractive we were dressed and barbered
alike and could pass for small farmers or farm bailiffs or
shepherds or carters yes or for village artisans if we chose 
our costume being in effect universal among the poor because of
its strength and cheapness i dont mean that it was really cheap
to a very poor person but i do mean that it was the cheapest
material there was for male attire manufactured material you
understand 

we slipped away an hour before dawn and by broad sun up had made
eight or ten miles and were in the midst of a sparsely settled
country i had a pretty heavy knapsack it was laden with
provisions provisions for the king to taper down on till he
could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage 

i found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside and then
gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with then i said
i would find some water for him and strolled away part of my
project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little
myself it had always been my custom to stand when in his presence 
even at the council board except upon those rare occasions when
the sitting was a very long one extending over hours then i had
a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert
and was as comfortable as the toothache i didnt want to break
him in suddenly but do it by degrees we should have to sit
together now when in company or people would notice but it would
not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when
there was no necessity for it 

i found the water some three hundred yards away and had been
resting about twenty minutes when i heard voices that is all
right i thought peasants going to work nobody else likely to be
stirring this early but the next moment these comers jingled into
sight around a turn of the road smartly clad people of quality 
with luggage mules and servants in their train i was off like
a shot through the bushes by the shortest cut for a while it
did seem that these people would pass the king before i could
get to him but desperation gives you wings you know and i canted
my body forward inflated my breast and held my breath and flew 
i arrived and in plenty good enough time too 

 pardon my king but its no time for ceremony jump jump to
your feet some quality are coming 

 is that a marvel let them come 

 but my liege you must not be seen sitting rise and stand in
humble posture while they pass you are a peasant you know 

 true i had forgot it so lost was i in planning of a huge war
with gaul he was up by this time but a farm could have got up
quicker if there was any kind of a boom in real estate and
right so a thought came randoming overthwart this majestic dream
the which 

 a humbler attitude my lord the king and quick duck your head 
 more still more droop it 

he did his honest best but lord it was no great things he looked
as humble as the leaning tower at pisa it is the most you could
say of it indeed it was such a thundering poor success that
it raised wondering scowls all along the line and a gorgeous
flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip but i jumped in
time and was under it when it fell and under cover of the volley
of coarse laughter which followed i spoke up sharply and warned
the king to take no notice he mastered himself for the moment 
but it was a sore tax he wanted to eat up the procession i said 

 it would end our adventures at the very start and we being
without weapons could do nothing with that armed gang if we
are going to succeed in our emprise we must not only look the
peasant but act the peasant 

 it is wisdom none can gainsay it let us go on sir boss 
i will take note and learn and do the best i may 

he kept his word he did the best he could but ive seen better 
if you have ever seen an active heedless enterprising child
going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day
long and an anxious mother at its heels all the while and just
saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with
each new experiment youve seen the king and me 

if i could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like 
i should have said no if anybody wants to make his living
exhibiting a king as a peasant let him take the layout i can
do better with a menagerie and last longer and yet during
the first three days i never allowed him to enter a hut or other
dwelling if he could pass muster anywhere during his early
novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road so to these
places we confined ourselves yes he certainly did the best he
could but what of that he didnt improve a bit that i could see 

he was always frightening me always breaking out with fresh
astonishers in new and unexpected places toward evening on
the second day what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk
from inside his robe 

 great guns my liege where did you get that 

 from a smuggler at the inn yester eve 

 what in the world possessed you to buy it 

 we have escaped divers dangers by wit thy wit but i have
bethought me that it were but prudence if i bore a weapon too 
thine might fail thee in some pinch 

 but people of our condition are not allowed to carry arms what
would a lord say yes or any other person of whatever condition
 if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person 

it was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then 
i persuaded him to throw the dirk away and it was as easy as
persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing
itself we walked along silent and thinking finally the king said 

 when ye know that i meditate a thing inconvenient or that hath
a peril in it why do you not warn me to cease from that project 

it was a startling question and a puzzler i didnt quite know
how to take hold of it or what to say and so of course i ended
by saying the natural thing 

 but sire how can i know what your thoughts are 

the king stopped dead in his tracks and stared at me 

 i believed thou wert greater than merlin and truly in magic
thou art but prophecy is greater than magic merlin is a prophet 

i saw i had made a blunder i must get back my lost ground 
after a deep reflection and careful planning i said 

 sire i have been misunderstood i will explain there are two
kinds of prophecy one is the gift to foretell things that are but
a little way off the other is the gift to foretell things that
are whole ages and centuries away which is the mightier gift 
do you think 

 oh the last most surely 

 true does merlin possess it 

 partly yes he foretold mysteries about my birth and future
kingship that were twenty years away 

 has he ever gone beyond that 

 he would not claim more i think 

 it is probably his limit all prophets have their limit the limit
of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years 

 these are few i ween 

 there have been two still greater ones whose limit was four
hundred and six hundred years and one whose limit compassed
even seven hundred and twenty 

 gramercy it is marvelous 

 but what are these in comparison with me they are nothing 

 what canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch
of time as 

 seven hundred years my liege as clear as the vision of an eagle
does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this
world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half 

my land you should have seen the kings eyes spread slowly open 
and lift the earths entire atmosphere as much as an inch that
settled brer merlin one never had any occasion to prove his
facts with these people all he had to do was to state them it
never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement 

 now then i continued i could work both kinds of prophecy
 the long and the short if i chose to take the trouble to keep
in practice but i seldom exercise any but the long kind because
the other is beneath my dignity it is properer to merlins sort
 stump tail prophets as we call them in the profession of course 
i whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy but not
often hardly ever in fact you will remember that there was
great talk when you reached the valley of holiness about my
having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival 
two or three days beforehand 

 indeed yes i mind it now 

 well i could have done it as much as forty times easier and
piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain if it had
been five hundred years away instead of two or three days 

 how amazing that it should be so 

 yes a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five
hundred years away easier than he can a thing thats only five
hundred seconds off 

 and yet in reason it should clearly be the other way it should
be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first 
for indeed it is so close by that one uninspired might almost
see it in truth the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods 
most strangely making the difficult easy and the easy difficult 

it was a wise head a peasants cap was no safe disguise for it 
you could know it for a kings under a diving bell if you could
hear it work its intellect 

i had a new trade now and plenty of business in it the king
was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen
during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live
in them from that time out i prophesied myself bald headed
trying to supply the demand i have done some indiscreet things in
my day but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the
worst still it had its ameliorations a prophet doesnt have
to have any brains they are good to have of course for the
ordinary exigencies of life but they are no use in professional
work it is the restfulest vocation there is when the spirit of
prophecy comes upon you you merely cake your intellect and lay it
off in a cool place for a rest and unship your jaw and leave it
alone it will work itself the result is prophecy 

every day a knight errant or so came along and the sight of them
fired the kings martial spirit every time he would have forgotten
himself sure and said something to them in a style a suspicious
shade or so above his ostensible degree and so i always got him
well out of the road in time then he would stand and look with
all his eyes and a proud light would flash from them and his
nostrils would inflate like a war horses and i knew he was
longing for a brush with them but about noon of the third day
i had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been
suggested by the whip stroke that had fallen to my share two days
before a precaution which i had afterward decided to leave untaken 
i was so loath to institute it but now i had just had a fresh
reminder while striding heedlessly along with jaw spread and
intellect at rest for i was prophesying i stubbed my toe and
fell sprawling i was so pale i couldnt think for a moment 
then i got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack 
i had that dynamite bomb in it done up in wool in a box it was
a good thing to have along the time would come when i could do
a valuable miracle with it maybe but it was a nervous thing
to have about me and i didnt like to ask the king to carry it 
yet i must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get
along with its society i got it out and slipped it into my scrip 
and just then here came a couple of knights the king stood 
stately as a statue gazing toward them had forgotten himself again 
of course and before i could get a word of warning out it was
time for him to skip and well that he did it too he supposed
they would turn aside turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt
under foot when had he ever turned aside himself or ever had
the chance to do it if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight
in time to judiciously save him the trouble the knights paid
no attention to the king at all it was his place to look out
himself and if he hadnt skipped he would have been placidly
ridden down and laughed at besides 

the king was in a flaming fury and launched out his challenge
and epithets with a most royal vigor the knights were some little
distance by now they halted greatly surprised and turned in
their saddles and looked back as if wondering if it might be worth
while to bother with such scum as we then they wheeled and
started for us not a moment must be lost i started for them 
i passed them at a rattling gait and as i went by i flung out a
hair lifting soul scorching thirteen jointed insult which made
the kings effort poor and cheap by comparison i got it out of
the nineteenth century where they know how they had such headway
that they were nearly to the king before they could check up 
then frantic with rage they stood up their horses on their hind
hoofs and whirled them around and the next moment here they came 
breast to breast i was seventy yards off then and scrambling up
a great bowlder at the roadside when they were within thirty
yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level depressed
their mailed heads and so with their horse hair plumes streaming
straight out behind most gallant to see this lightning express
came tearing for me when they were within fifteen yards i sent
that bomb with a sure aim and it struck the ground just under
the horses noses 

yes it was a neat thing very neat and pretty to see it resembled
a steamboat explosion on the mississippi and during the next
fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic
fragments of knights and hardware and horse flesh i say we 
for the king joined the audience of course as soon as he had got
his breath again there was a hole there which would afford steady
work for all the people in that region for some years to come
 in trying to explain it i mean as for filling it up that service
would be comparatively prompt and would fall to the lot of a
select few peasants of that seignory and they wouldnt get
anything for it either 

but i explained it to the king myself i said it was done with a
dynamite bomb this information did him no damage because it
left him as intelligent as he was before however it was a noble
miracle in his eyes and was another settler for merlin i thought
it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort
that it couldnt be done except when the atmospheric conditions
were just right otherwise he would be encoring it every time we
had a good subject and that would be inconvenient because i
hadnt any more bombs along 



chapter xxviii

drilling the king

on the morning of the fourth day when it was just sunrise and we
had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn i came to a resolution 
the king must be drilled things could not go on so he must be
taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled or we
couldnt ever venture to enter a dwelling the very cats would know
this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant so i called a halt
and said 

 sire as between clothes and countenance you are all right there
is no discrepancy but as between your clothes and your bearing 
you are all wrong there is a most noticeable discrepancy your
soldierly stride your lordly port these will not do you stand
too straight your looks are too high too confident the cares
of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders they do not droop the chin 
they do not depress the high level of the eye glance they do not
put doubt and fear in the heart and hang out the signs of them
in slouching body and unsure step it is the sordid cares of
the lowly born that do these things you must learn the trick 
you must imitate the trademarks of poverty misery oppression 
insult and the other several and common inhumanities that sap
the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and
approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters or the very
infants will know you for better than your disguise and we shall go
to pieces at the first hut we stop at pray try to walk like this 

the king took careful note and then tried an imitation 

 pretty fair pretty fair chin a little lower please there very
good eyes too high pray dont look at the horizon look at the
ground ten steps in front of you ah that is better that is
very good wait please you betray too much vigor too much
decision you want more of a shamble look at me please this is
what i mean now you are getting it that is the idea at least 
it sort of approaches it yes that is pretty fair but 
there is a great big something wanting i dont quite know what
it is please walk thirty yards so that i can get a perspective
on the thing now then your heads right speeds right 
shoulders right eyes right chin right gait carriage general
style right everythings right and yet the fact remains the
aggregates wrong the account dont balance do it again 
please now i think i begin to see what it is yes ive
struck it you see the genuine spiritlessness is wanting thats
whats the trouble its all amateur mechanical details all
right almost to a hair everything about the delusion perfect 
except that it dont delude 

 what then must one do to prevail 

 let me think i cant seem to quite get at it in fact there
isnt anything that can right the matter but practice this is
a good place for it roots and stony ground to break up your
stately gait a region not liable to interruption only one field
and one hut in sight and they so far away that nobody could
see us from there it will be well to move a little off the road
and put in the whole day drilling you sire 

after the drill had gone on a little while i said 

 now sire imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder 
and the family are before us proceed please accost the head
of the house 

the king unconsciously straightened up like a monument and said 
with frozen austerity 

 varlet bring a seat and serve to me what cheer ye have 

 ah your grace that is not well done 

 in what lacketh it 

 these people do not call each other varlets 

 nay is that true 

 yes only those above them call them so 

 then must i try again i will call him villein 

 no no for he may be a freeman 

 ah so then peradventure i should call him goodman 

 that would answer your grace but it would be still better if
you said friend or brother 

 brother to dirt like that 

 ah but we are pretending to be dirt like that too 

 it is even true i will say it brother bring a seat and
thereto what cheer ye have withal now tis right 

 not quite not wholly right you have asked for one not us 
 for one not both food for one a seat for one 

the king looked puzzled he wasnt a very heavy weight intellectually 
his head was an hour glass it could stow an idea but it had to do
it a grain at a time not the whole idea at once 

 would you have a seat also and sit 

 if i did not sit the man would perceive that we were only pretending
to be equals and playing the deception pretty poorly too 

 it is well and truly said how wonderful is truth come it in
whatsoever unexpected form it may yes he must bring out seats
and food for both and in serving us present not ewer and napkin
with more show of respect to the one than to the other 

 and there is even yet a detail that needs correcting he must
bring nothing outside we will go in in among the dirt and
possibly other repulsive things and take the food with the
household and after the fashion of the house and all on equal
terms except the man be of the serf class and finally there
will be no ewer and no napkin whether he be serf or free please
walk again my liege there it is better it is the best yet 
but not perfect the shoulders have known no ignobler burden
than iron mail and they will not stoop 

 give me then the bag i will learn the spirit that goeth
with burdens that have not honor it is the spirit that stoopeth
the shoulders i ween and not the weight for armor is heavy 
yet it is a proud burden and a man standeth straight in it 
nay but me no buts offer me no objections i will have the thing 
strap it upon my back 

he was complete now with that knapsack on and looked as little
like a king as any man i had ever seen but it was an obstinate
pair of shoulders they could not seem to learn the trick of
stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness the drill went on 
i prompting and correcting 

 now make believe you are in debt and eaten up by relentless
creditors you are out of work which is horse shoeing let us
say and can get none and your wife is sick your children are
crying because they are hungry 

and so on and so on i drilled him as representing in turn all
sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and
misfortunes but lord it was only just words words they meant
nothing in the world to him i might just as well have whistled 
words realize nothing vivify nothing to you unless you have
suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to
describe there are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and
complacently about the working classes and satisfy themselves
that a days hard intellectual work is very much harder than
a days hard manual toil and is righteously entitled to much
bigger pay why they really think that you know because they
know all about the one but havent tried the other but i know
all about both and so far as i am concerned there isnt money
enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days 
but i will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as
near nothing as you can cipher it down and i will be satisfied too 

intellectual work is misnamed it is a pleasure a dissipation 
and is its own highest reward the poorest paid architect 
engineer general author sculptor painter lecturer advocate 
legislator actor preacher singer is constructively in heaven
when he is at work and as for the musician with the fiddle bow
in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the
ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him why 
certainly he is at work if you wish to call it that but lord 
its a sarcasm just the same the law of work does seem utterly
unfair but there it is and nothing can change it the higher
the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it the higher shall
be his pay in cash also and its also the very law of those
transparent swindles transmissible nobility and kingship 



chapter xxix

the smallpox hut

when we arrived at that hut at mid afternoon we saw no signs
of life about it the field near by had been denuded of its crop
some time before and had a skinned look so exhaustively had
it been harvested and gleaned fences sheds everything had a
ruined look and were eloquent of poverty no animal was around
anywhere no living thing in sight the stillness was awful it
was like the stillness of death the cabin was a one story one 
whose thatch was black with age and ragged from lack of repair 

the door stood a trifle ajar we approached it stealthily on tiptoe
and at half breath for that is the way ones feeling makes him do 
at such a time the king knocked we waited no answer knocked
again no answer i pushed the door softly open and looked in 
i made out some dim forms and a woman started up from the ground
and stared at me as one does who is wakened from sleep presently
she found her voice 

 have mercy she pleaded all is taken nothing is left 

 i have not come to take anything poor woman 

 you are not a priest 

 no 

 nor come not from the lord of the manor 

 no i am a stranger 

 oh then for the fear of god who visits with misery and death
such as be harmless tarry not here but fly this place is under
his curse and his churchs 

 let me come in and help you you are sick and in trouble 

i was better used to the dim light now i could see her hollow
eyes fixed upon me i could see how emaciated she was 

 i tell you the place is under the churchs ban save yourself
 and go before some straggler see thee here and report it 

 give yourself no trouble about me i dont care anything for the
churchs curse let me help you 

 now all good spirits if there be any such bless thee for that
word would god i had a sup of water but hold hold forget
i said it and fly for there is that here that even he that
feareth not the church must fear this disease whereof we die 
leave us thou brave good stranger and take with thee such
whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give 

but before this i had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing
past the king on my way to the brook it was ten yards away 
when i got back and entered the king was within and was opening
the shutter that closed the window hole to let in air and light 
the place was full of a foul stench i put the bowl to the womans
lips and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came
open and a strong light flooded her face smallpox 

i sprang to the king and said in his ear 

 out of the door on the instant sire the woman is dying of that
disease that wasted the skirts of camelot two years ago 

he did not budge 

 of a truth i shall remain and likewise help 

i whispered again 

 king it must not be you must go 

 ye mean well and ye speak not unwisely but it were shame that
a king should know fear and shame that belted knight should
withhold his hand where be such as need succor peace i will
not go it is you who must go the churchs ban is not upon me 
but it forbiddeth you to be here and she will deal with you with
a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass 

it was a desperate place for him to be in and might cost him his
life but it was no use to argue with him if he considered his
knightly honor at stake here that was the end of argument he
would stay and nothing could prevent it i was aware of that 
and so i dropped the subject the woman spoke 

 fair sir of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there 
and bring me news of what ye find be not afraid to report 
for times can come when even a mothers heart is past breaking
 being already broke 

 abide said the king and give the woman to eat i will go 
and he put down the knapsack 

i turned to start but the king had already started he halted 
and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light and had not
noticed us thus far or spoken 

 is it your husband the king asked 

 yes 

 is he asleep 

 god be thanked for that one charity yes these three hours 
where shall i pay to the full my gratitude for my heart is
bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now 

i said 

 we will be careful we will not wake him 

 ah no that ye will not for he is dead 

 dead 

 yes what triumph it is to know it none can harm him none
insult him more he is in heaven now and happy or if not there 
he bides in hell and is content for in that place he will find
neither abbot nor yet bishop we were boy and girl together we
were man and wife these five and twenty years and never separated
till this day think how long that is to love and suffer together 
this morning was he out of his mind and in his fancy we were
boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields and so in
that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther still
lightly gossiping and entered into those other fields we know
not of and was shut away from mortal sight and so there was
no parting for in his fancy i went with him he knew not but
i went with him my hand in his my young soft hand not this
withered claw ah yes to go and know it not to separate and
know it not how could one go peace fuller than that it was
his reward for a cruel life patiently borne 

there was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where
the ladder was it was the king descending i could see that he
was bearing something in one arm and assisting himself with the
other he came forward into the light upon his breast lay a
slender girl of fifteen she was but half conscious she was dying
of smallpox here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility 
its utmost summit this was challenging death in the open field
unarmed with all the odds against the challenger no reward set
upon the contest and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold
to gaze and applaud and yet the kings bearing was as serenely
brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight
meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel he
was great now sublimely great the rude statues of his ancestors
in his palace should have an addition i would see to that and it
would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon like the
rest it would be a king in commoners garb bearing death in his
arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and
be comforted 

he laid the girl down by her mother who poured out endearments
and caresses from an overflowing heart and one could detect a
flickering faint light of response in the childs eyes but that
was all the mother hung over her kissing her petting her and
imploring her to speak but the lips only moved and no sound came 
i snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack but the woman forbade
me and said 

 no she does not suffer it is better so it might bring her back
to life none that be so good and kind as ye are would do her
that cruel hurt for look you what is left to live for her
brothers are gone her father is gone her mother goeth the
churchs curse is upon her and none may shelter or befriend her
even though she lay perishing in the road she is desolate i have
not asked you good heart if her sister be still on live here
overhead i had no need ye had gone back else and not left
the poor thing forsaken 

 she lieth at peace interrupted the king in a subdued voice 

 i would not change it how rich is this day in happiness ah 
my annis thou shalt join thy sister soon thourt on thy way 
and these be merciful friends that will not hinder 

and so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again and
softly stroking her face and hair and kissing her and calling her
by endearing names but there was scarcely sign of response now
in the glazing eyes i saw tears well from the kings eyes and
trickle down his face the woman noticed them too and said 

 ah i know that sign thoust a wife at home poor soul and
you and she have gone hungry to bed manys the time that the
little ones might have your crust you know what poverty is and
the daily insults of your betters and the heavy hand of the church
and the king 

the king winced under this accidental home shot but kept still 
he was learning his part and he was playing it well too for
a pretty dull beginner i struck up a diversion i offered the
woman food and liquor but she refused both she would allow
nothing to come between her and the release of death then i slipped
away and brought the dead child from aloft and laid it by her 
this broke her down again and there was another scene that was
full of heartbreak by and by i made another diversion and beguiled
her to sketch her story 

 ye know it well yourselves having suffered it for truly none
of our condition in britain escape it it is the old weary tale 
we fought and struggled and succeeded meaning by success that
we lived and did not die more than that is not to be claimed no
troubles came that we could not outlive till this year brought
them then came they all at once as one might say and overwhelmed
us years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on
our farm in the best part of it too a grievous wrong and shame 

 but it was his right interrupted the king 

 none denieth that indeed an the law mean anything what is
the lords is his and what is mine is his also our farm was
ours by lease therefore twas likewise his to do with it as he
would some little time ago three of those trees were found hewn
down our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime 
well in his lordships dungeon there they lie who saith there
shall they lie and rot till they confess they have naught to
confess being innocent wherefore there will they remain until
they die ye know that right well i ween think how this left us 
a man a woman and two children to gather a crop that was planted
by so much greater force yes and protect it night and day from
pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt
by any of our sort when my lords crop was nearly ready for
the harvest so also was ours when his bell rang to call us to
his fields to harvest his crop for nothing he would not allow that
i and my two girls should count for our three captive sons but
for only two of them so for the lacking one were we daily fined 
all this time our own crop was perishing through neglect and so
both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares
of it were suffering through damage in the end the fines ate up
our crop and they took it all they took it all and made us harvest
it for them without pay or food and we starving then the worst
came when i being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys 
and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery
and despair uttered a deep blasphemy oh a thousand of them 
 against the church and the churchs ways it was ten days ago 
i had fallen sick with this disease and it was to the priest
i said the words for he was come to chide me for lack of due
humility under the chastening hand of god he carried my trespass
to his betters i was stubborn wherefore presently upon my head
and upon all heads that were dear to me fell the curse of rome 

 since that day we are avoided shunned with horror none has
come near this hut to know whether we live or not the rest of us
were taken down then i roused me and got up as wife and mother
will it was little they could have eaten in any case it was
less than little they had to eat but there was water and i gave
them that how they craved it and how they blessed it but the
end came yesterday my strength broke down yesterday was the
last time i ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive 
i have lain here all these hours these ages ye may say listening 
listening for any sound up there that 

she gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter then cried
out oh my darling and feebly gathered the stiffening form
to her sheltering arms she had recognized the death rattle 



chapter xxx

the tragedy of the manor house

at midnight all was over and we sat in the presence of four
corpses we covered them with such rags as we could find and
started away fastening the door behind us their home must be
these peoples grave for they could not have christian burial 
or be admitted to consecrated ground they were as dogs wild
beasts lepers and no soul that valued its hope of eternal life
would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and
smitten outcasts 

we had not moved four steps when i caught a sound as of footsteps
upon gravel my heart flew to my throat we must not be seen
coming from that house i plucked at the kings robe and we drew
back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin 

 now we are safe i said but it was a close call so to speak 
if the night had been lighter he might have seen us no doubt 
he seemed to be so near 

 mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all 

 true but man or beast it will be wise to stay here a minute
and let it get by and out of the way 

 hark it cometh hither 

true again the step was coming toward us straight toward the hut 
it must be a beast then and we might as well have saved our
trepidation i was going to step out but the king laid his hand
upon my arm there was a moment of silence then we heard a soft
knock on the cabin door it made me shiver presently the knock
was repeated and then we heard these words in a guarded voice 

 mother father open we have got free and we bring news to
pale your cheeks but glad your hearts and we may not tarry but
must fly and but they answer not mother father 

i drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered 

 come now we can get to the road 

the king hesitated was going to demur but just then we heard
the door give way and knew that those desolate men were in the
presence of their dead 

 come my liege in a moment they will strike a light and then
will follow that which it would break your heart to hear 

he did not hesitate this time the moment we were in the road
i ran and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed 
i did not want to think of what was happening in the hut i couldnt
bear it i wanted to drive it out of my mind so i struck into the
first subject that lay under that one in my mind 

 i have had the disease those people died of and so have nothing
to fear but if you have not had it also 

he broke in upon me to say he was in trouble and it was his
conscience that was troubling him 

 these young men have got free they say but how it is not
likely that their lord hath set them free 

 oh no i make no doubt they escaped 

 that is my trouble i have a fear that this is so and your
suspicion doth confirm it you having the same fear 

 i should not call it by that name though i do suspect that they
escaped but if they did i am not sorry certainly 

 i am not sorry i think but 

 what is it what is there for one to be troubled about 

 if they did escape then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon
them and deliver them again to their lord for it is not seemly
that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high handed
outrage from persons of their base degree 

there it was again he could see only one side of it he was
born so educated so his veins were full of ancestral blood that
was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality brought down
by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done
its share toward poisoning the stream to imprison these men
without proof and starve their kindred was no harm for they were
merely peasants and subject to the will and pleasure of their lord 
no matter what fearful form it might take but for these men to
break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage and a thing
not to be countenanced by any conscientious person who knew his
duty to his sacred caste 

i worked more than half an hour before i got him to change the
subject and even then an outside matter did it for me this was
a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a
small hill a red glow a good way off 

 thats a fire said i 

fires interested me considerably because i was getting a good
deal of an insurance business started and was also training some
horses and building some steam fire engines with an eye to a paid
fire department by and by the priests opposed both my fire and
life insurance on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to
hinder the decrees of god and if you pointed out that they did not
hinder the decrees in the least but only modified the hard
consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck they
retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of god and was
just as bad so they managed to damage those industries more
or less but i got even on my accident business as a rule a knight
is a lummox and some times even a labrick and hence open to pretty
poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition monger 
but even he could see the practical side of a thing once in a while 
and so of late you couldnt clean up a tournament and pile the
result without finding one of my accident tickets in every helmet 

we stood there awhile in the thick darkness and stillness looking
toward the red blur in the distance and trying to make out the
meaning of a far away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the
night sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less
remote but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause
and nature it dulled and sank again carrying its mystery with it 
we started down the hill in its direction and the winding road
plunged us at once into almost solid darkness darkness that was
packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls we groped
along down for half a mile perhaps that murmur growing more and
more distinct all the time the coming storm threatening more and
more with now and then a little shiver of wind a faint show of
lightning and dull grumblings of distant thunder i was in the
lead i ran against something a soft heavy something which gave 
slightly to the impulse of my weight at the same moment the
lightning glared out and within a foot of my face was the writhing
face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree that is 
it seemed to be writhing but it was not it was a grewsome sight 
straightway there was an ear splitting explosion of thunder and
the bottom of heaven fell out the rain poured down in a deluge 
no matter we must try to cut this man down on the chance that
there might be life in him yet mustnt we the lightning came
quick and sharp now and the place was alternately noonday and
midnight one moment the man would be hanging before me in an
intense light and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness 
i told the king we must cut him down the king at once objected 

 if he hanged himself he was willing to lose him property to
his lord so let him be if others hanged him belike they had
the right let him hang 

 but 

 but me no buts but even leave him as he is and for yet another
reason when the lightning cometh again there look abroad 

two others hanging within fifty yards of us 

 it is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk 
they are past thanking you come it is unprofitable to tarry here 

there was reason in what he said so we moved on within the next
mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning 
and altogether it was a grisly excursion that murmur was a murmur
no longer it was a roar a roar of mens voices a man came flying
by now dimly through the darkness and other men chasing him 
they disappeared presently another case of the kind occurred 
and then another and another then a sudden turn of the road
brought us in sight of that fire it was a large manor house and
little or nothing was left of it and everywhere men were flying
and other men raging after them in pursuit 

i warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers 
we would better get away from the light until matters should
improve we stepped back a little and hid in the edge of the
wood from this hiding place we saw both men and women hunted
by the mob the fearful work went on until nearly dawn then 
the fire being out and the storm spent the voices and flying
footsteps presently ceased and darkness and stillness reigned again 

we ventured out and hurried cautiously away and although we were
worn out and sleepy we kept on until we had put this place some
miles behind us then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal
burner and got what was to be had a woman was up and about but
the man was still asleep on a straw shake down on the clay floor 
the woman seemed uneasy until i explained that we were travelers
and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night 
she became talkative then and asked if we had heard of the
terrible goings on at the manor house of abblasoure yes we had
heard of them but what we wanted now was rest and sleep the
king broke in 

 sell us the house and take yourselves away for we be perilous
company being late come from people that died of the spotted death 

it was good of him but unnecessary one of the commonest decorations
of the nation was the waffle iron face i had early noticed that
the woman and her husband were both so decorated she made us
entirely welcome and had no fears and plainly she was immensely
impressed by the kings proposition for of course it was a good
deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the kings
humble appearance who was ready to buy a mans house for the sake
of a nights lodging it gave her a large respect for us and she
strained the lean possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make
us comfortable 

we slept till far into the afternoon and then got up hungry enough to
make cotter fare quite palatable to the king the more particularly
as it was scant in quantity and also in variety it consisted
solely of onions salt and the national black bread made out of
horse feed the woman told us about the affair of the evening
before at ten or eleven at night when everybody was in bed 
the manor house burst into flames the country side swarmed to
the rescue and the family were saved with one exception the
master he did not appear everybody was frantic over this loss 
and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking the
burning house seeking that valuable personage but after a while
he was found what was left of him which was his corpse it was
in a copse three hundred yards away bound gagged stabbed in a
dozen places 

who had done this suspicion fell upon a humble family in the
neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness
by the baron and from these people the suspicion easily extended
itself to their relatives and familiars a suspicion was enough 
my lords liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against
these people and were promptly joined by the community in general 
the womans husband had been active with the mob and had not
returned home until nearly dawn he was gone now to find out
what the general result had been while we were still talking he
came back from his quest his report was revolting enough eighteen
persons hanged or butchered and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners
lost in the fire 

 and how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults 

 thirteen 

 then every one of them was lost 

 yes all 

 but the people arrived in time to save the family how is it they
could save none of the prisoners 

the man looked puzzled and said 

 would one unlock the vaults at such a time marry some would
have escaped 

 then you mean that nobody did unlock them 

 none went near them either to lock or unlock it standeth to
reason that the bolts were fast wherefore it was only needful
to establish a watch so that if any broke the bonds he might not
escape but be taken none were taken 

 natheless three did escape said the king and ye will do well
to publish it and set justice upon their track for these murthered
the baron and fired the house 

i was just expecting he would come out with that for a moment
the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and
an impatience to go out and spread it then a sudden something
else betrayed itself in their faces and they began to ask questions 
i answered the questions myself and narrowly watched the effects
produced i was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these
three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere that
our hosts continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now
only pretended and not real the king did not notice the change 
and i was glad of that i worked the conversation around toward
other details of the nights proceedings and noted that these
people were relieved to have it take that direction 

the painful thing observable about all this business was the
alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their
cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common
oppressor this man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel
between a person of their own class and his lord it was the natural
and proper and rightful thing for that poor devils whole caste
to side with the master and fight his battle for him without ever
stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter this
man had been out helping to hang his neighbors and had done his
work with zeal and yet was aware that there was nothing against
them but a mere suspicion with nothing back of it describable
as evidence still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything
horrible about it 

this was depressing to a man with the dream of a republic in his
head it reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away when
the poor whites of our south who were always despised and
frequently insulted by the slave lords around them and who owed
their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their
midst were yet pusillanimously ready to side with the slave lords
in all political moves for the upholding and perpetuating of
slavery and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out
their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very
institution which degraded them and there was only one redeeming
feature connected with that pitiful piece of history and that was 
that secretly the poor white did detest the slave lord and did
feel his own shame that feeling was not brought to the surface 
but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out 
under favoring circumstances was something in fact it was enough 
for it showed that a man is at bottom a man after all even if it
doesnt show on the outside 

well as it turned out this charcoal burner was just the twin of
the southern poor white of the far future the king presently
showed impatience and said 

 an ye prattle here all the day justice will miscarry think ye
the criminals will abide in their fathers house they are fleeing 
they are not waiting you should look to it that a party of horse
be set upon their track 

the woman paled slightly but quite perceptibly and the man looked
flustered and irresolute i said 

 come friend i will walk a little way with you and explain which
direction i think they would try to take if they were merely
resisters of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity i would try
to protect them from capture but when men murder a person of
high degree and likewise burn his house that is another matter 

the last remark was for the king to quiet him on the road
the man pulled his resolution together and began the march with
a steady gait but there was no eagerness in it by and by i said 

 what relation were these men to you cousins 

he turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him and
stopped trembling 

 ah my god how know ye that 

 i didnt know it it was a chance guess 

 poor lads they are lost and good lads they were too 

 were you actually going yonder to tell on them 

he didnt quite know how to take that but he said hesitatingly 

 ye s 

 then i think you are a damned scoundrel 

it made him as glad as if i had called him an angel 

 say the good words again brother for surely ye mean that ye
would not betray me an i failed of my duty 

 duty there is no duty in the matter except the duty to keep
still and let those men get away theyve done a righteous deed 

he looked pleased pleased and touched with apprehension at the
same time he looked up and down the road to see that no one
was coming and then said in a cautious voice 

 from what land come you brother that you speak such perilous
words and seem not to be afraid 

 they are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste 
i take it you would not tell anybody i said them 

 i i would be drawn asunder by wild horses first 

 well then let me say my say i have no fears of your repeating
it i think devils work has been done last night upon those
innocent poor people that old baron got only what he deserved 
if i had my way all his kind should have the same luck 

fear and depression vanished from the mans manner and gratefulness
and a brave animation took their place 

 even though you be a spy and your words a trap for my undoing 
yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others
like to them i would go to the gallows happy as having had one
good feast at least in a starved life and i will say my say now 
and ye may report it if ye be so minded i helped to hang my
neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of
zeal in the masters cause the others helped for none other reason 
all rejoice to day that he is dead but all do go about seemingly
sorrowing and shedding the hypocrites tear for in that lies
safety i have said the words i have said the words the only
ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth and the reward of
that taste is sufficient lead on an ye will be it even to the
scaffold for i am ready 

there it was you see a man is a man at bottom whole ages
of abuse and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him 
whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken yes there is
plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded
people that ever existed even the russians plenty of manhood
in them even in the germans if one could but force it out of
its timid and suspicious privacy to overthrow and trample in the
mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever
supported it we should see certain things yet let us hope and
believe first a modified monarchy till arthurs days were done 
then the destruction of the throne nobility abolished every
member of it bound out to some useful trade universal suffrage
instituted and the whole government placed in the hands of the
men and women of the nation there to remain yes there was no
occasion to give up my dream yet a while 



chapter xxxi

marco

we strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now and
talked we must dispose of about the amount of time it ought
to take to go to the little hamlet of abblasoure and put justice
on the track of those murderers and get back home again and
meantime i had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet 
never lost its novelty for me since i had been in arthurs kingdom 
the behavior born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste of chance
passers by toward each other toward the shaven monk who trudged
along with his cowl tilted back and the sweat washing down his
fat jowls the coal burner was deeply reverent to the gentleman
he was abject with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was
cordial and gossipy and when a slave passed by with a countenance
respectfully lowered this chaps nose was in the air he couldnt
even see him well there are times when one would like to hang
the whole human race and finish the farce 

presently we struck an incident a small mob of half naked boys
and girls came tearing out of the woods scared and shrieking 
the eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years
old they implored help but they were so beside themselves that
we couldnt make out what the matter was however we plunged
into the wood they skurrying in the lead and the trouble was
quickly revealed they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope 
and he was kicking and struggling in the process of choking to
death we rescued him and fetched him around it was some more
human nature the admiring little folk imitating their elders 
they were playing mob and had achieved a success which promised
to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for 

it was not a dull excursion for me i managed to put in the time
very well i made various acquaintanceships and in my quality
of stranger was able to ask as many questions as i wanted to 
a thing which naturally interested me as a statesman was the
matter of wages i picked up what i could under that head during
the afternoon a man who hasnt had much experience and doesnt
think is apt to measure a nations prosperity or lack of prosperity
by the mere size of the prevailing wages if the wages be high the
nation is prosperous if low it isnt which is an error it
isnt what sum you get its how much you can buy with it thats
the important thing and its that that tells whether your wages
are high in fact or only high in name i could remember how it
was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century 
in the north a carpenter got three dollars a day gold valuation 
in the south he got fifty payable in confederate shinplasters
worth a dollar a bushel in the north a suit of overalls cost
three dollars a days wages in the south it cost seventy five
 which was two days wages other things were in proportion 
consequently wages were twice as high in the north as they were
in the south because the one wage had that much more purchasing
power than the other had 

yes i made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that
gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation
 lots of milrays lots of mills lots of cents a good many nickels 
and some silver all this among the artisans and commonalty
generally yes and even some gold but that was at the bank 
that is to say the goldsmiths i dropped in there while marco 
the son of marco was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter
of a pound of salt and asked for change for a twenty dollar gold
piece they furnished it that is after they had chewed the piece 
and rung it on the counter and tried acid on it and asked me
where i got it and who i was and where i was from and where
i was going to and when i expected to get there and perhaps
a couple of hundred more questions and when they got aground 
i went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily 
told them i owned a dog and his name was watch and my first wife
was a free will baptist and her grandfather was a prohibitionist 
and i used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart
on the inside of his upper lip and died in the hope of a glorious
resurrection and so on and so on and so on till even that
hungry village questioner began to look satisfied and also a shade
put out but he had to respect a man of my financial strength 
and so he didnt give me any lip but i noticed he took it out of
his underlings which was a perfectly natural thing to do yes 
they changed my twenty but i judged it strained the bank a little 
which was a thing to be expected for it was the same as walking
into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring
the boss of it to change a two thousand dollar bill for you all
of a sudden he could do it maybe but at the same time he
would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much
money around in his pocket which was probably this goldsmiths
thought too for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing
after me with reverent admiration 

our new money was not only handsomely circulating but its language
was already glibly in use that is to say people had dropped
the names of the former moneys and spoke of things as being worth
so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now it was very
gratifying we were progressing that was sure 

i got to know several master mechanics but about the most interesting
fellow among them was the blacksmith dowley he was a live man
and a brisk talker and had two journeymen and three apprentices 
and was doing a raging business in fact he was getting rich 
hand over fist and was vastly respected marco was very proud of
having such a man for a friend he had taken me there ostensibly
to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his
charcoal but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar
terms he was on with this great man dowley and i fraternized
at once i had had just such picked men splendid fellows under
me in the colt arms factory i was bound to see more of him so
i invited him to come out to marcos sunday and dine with us 
marco was appalled and held his breath and when the grandee
accepted he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished
at the condescension 

marcos joy was exuberant but only for a moment then he grew
thoughtful then sad and when he heard me tell dowley i should
have dickon the boss mason and smug the boss wheelwright out
there too the coal dust on his face turned to chalk and he lost
his grip but i knew what was the matter with him it was the
expense he saw ruin before him he judged that his financial
days were numbered however on our way to invite the others 
i said 

 you must allow me to have these friends come and you must also
allow me to pay the costs 

his face cleared and he said with spirit 

 but not all of it not all of it ye cannot well bear a burden
like to this alone 

i stopped him and said 

 now lets understand each other on the spot old friend i am
only a farm bailiff it is true but i am not poor nevertheless 
i have been very fortunate this year you would be astonished
to know how i have thriven i tell you the honest truth when i say
i could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never
care that for the expense and i snapped my fingers i could
see myself rise a foot at a time in marcos estimation and when
i fetched out those last words i was become a very tower for style
and altitude so you see you must let me have my way you
cant contribute a cent to this orgy thats settled 

 its grand and good of you 

 no it isnt youve opened your house to jones and me in the
most generous way jones was remarking upon it to day just before
you came back from the village for although he wouldnt be likely
to say such a thing to you because jones isnt a talker and is
diffident in society he has a good heart and a grateful and
knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated yes you and
your wife have been very hospitable toward us 

 ah brother tis nothing such hospitality 

 but it is something the best a man has freely given is always
something and is as good as a prince can do and ranks right
along beside it for even a prince can but do his best and so
well shop around and get up this layout now and dont you worry
about the expense im one of the worst spendthrifts that ever
was born why do you know sometimes in a single week i spend
 but never mind about that youd never believe it anyway 

and so we went gadding along dropping in here and there pricing
things and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot and now
and then running across pathetic reminders of it in the persons of
shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes
had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged 
the raiment of marco and his wife was of coarse tow linen and
linsey woolsey respectively and resembled township maps it being
made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added township
by township in the course of five or six years until hardly a
hands breadth of the original garments was surviving and present 
now i wanted to fit these people out with new suits on account of
that swell company and i didnt know just how to get at it
 with delicacy until at last it struck me that as i had already
been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king it would
be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial
sort so i said 

 and marco theres another thing which you must permit out of
kindness for jones because you wouldnt want to offend him 
he was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way but
he is so diffident he couldnt venture it himself and so he begged
me to buy some little things and give them to you and dame phyllis
and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from
him you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing
 and so i said i would and we would keep mum well his idea
was a new outfit of clothes for you both 

 oh it is wastefulness it may not be brother it may not be 
consider the vastness of the sum 

 hang the vastness of the sum try to keep quiet for a moment 
and see how it would seem a body cant get in a word edgeways 
you talk so much you ought to cure that marco it isnt good
form you know and it will grow on you if you dont check it 
yes well step in here now and price this mans stuff and dont
forget to remember to not let on to jones that you know he had
anything to do with it you cant think how curiously sensitive
and proud he is hes a farmer pretty fairly well to do farmer
 and im his bailiff but the imagination of that man why 
sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off youd
think he was one of the swells of the earth and you might listen
to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer especially if
he talked agriculture he thinks hes a sheol of a farmer thinks
hes old grayback from wayback but between you and me privately
he dont know as much about farming as he does about running
a kingdom still whatever he talks about you want to drop your
underjaw and listen the same as if you had never heard such
incredible wisdom in all your life before and were afraid you
might die before you got enough of it that will please jones 

it tickled marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character 
but it also prepared him for accidents and in my experience when
you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and
cant remember it more than about half the time you cant take
too many precautions 

this was the best store we had come across yet it had everything
in it in small quantities from anvils and drygoods all the way
down to fish and pinchbeck jewelry i concluded i would bunch
my whole invoice right here and not go pricing around any more 
so i got rid of marco by sending him off to invite the mason and
the wheelwright which left the field free to me for i never care
to do a thing in a quiet way its got to be theatrical or i dont
take any interest in it i showed up money enough in a careless
way to corral the shopkeepers respect and then i wrote down
a list of the things i wanted and handed it to him to see if he
could read it he could and was proud to show that he could 
he said he had been educated by a priest and could both read
and write he ran it through and remarked with satisfaction that
it was a pretty heavy bill well and so it was for a little
concern like that i was not only providing a swell dinner but
some odds and ends of extras i ordered that the things be carted
out and delivered at the dwelling of marco the son of marco 
by saturday evening and send me the bill at dinner time sunday 
he said i could depend upon his promptness and exactitude it was
the rule of the house he also observed that he would throw in
a couple of miller guns for the marcos gratis that everybody
was using them now he had a mighty opinion of that clever
device i said 

 and please fill them up to the middle mark too and add that
to the bill 

he would with pleasure he filled them and i took them with
me i couldnt venture to tell him that the miller gun was a
little invention of my own and that i had officially ordered that
every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them
at government price which was the merest trifle and the shopkeeper
got that not the government we furnished them for nothing 

the king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall he
had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of gaul
with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back and the afternoon
had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again 



chapter xxxii

dowleys humiliation

well when that cargo arrived toward sunset saturday afternoon 
i had my hands full to keep the marcos from fainting they were
sure jones and i were ruined past help and they blamed themselves
as accessories to this bankruptcy you see in addition to the
dinner materials which called for a sufficiently round sum 
i had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family 
for instance a big lot of wheat a delicacy as rare to the tables
of their class as was ice cream to a hermits also a sizeable
deal dinner table also two entire pounds of salt which was
another piece of extravagance in those peoples eyes also crockery 
stools the clothes a small cask of beer and so on i instructed
the marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness so as to give
me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little concerning
the new clothes the simple couple were like children they were up
and down all night to see if it wasnt nearly daylight so that
they could put them on and they were into them at last as much
as an hour before dawn was due then their pleasure not to say
delirium was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it
paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered 
the king had slept just as usual like the dead the marcos could
not thank him for their clothes that being forbidden but they
tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful
they were which all went for nothing he didnt notice any change 

it turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is
just a june day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be
out of doors toward noon the guests arrived and we assembled
under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances 
even the kings reserve melted a little though it was some little
trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of jones along at
first i had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer 
but i had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing
stand at that and not elaborate it any because he was just the
kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like
that if you didnt warn him his tongue was so handy and his
spirit so willing and his information so uncertain 

dowley was in fine feather and i early got him started and then
adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and
himself for a hero and then it was good to sit there and hear him
hum self made man you know they know how to talk they do
deserve more credit than any other breed of men yes that is true 
and they are among the very first to find it out too he told how
he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends
able to help him how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest
master lived how his days work was from sixteen to eighteen hours
long and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a
half fed condition how his faithful endeavors finally attracted
the attention of a good blacksmith who came near knocking him
dead with kindness by suddenly offering when he was totally
unprepared to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years
and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade or mystery 
as dowley called it that was his first great rise his first
gorgeous stroke of fortune and you saw that he couldnt yet speak
of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a
gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human
being he got no new clothing during his apprenticeship but on
his graduation day his master tricked him out in spang new tow linens
and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine 

 i remember me of that day the wheelwright sang out with
enthusiasm 

 and i likewise cried the mason i would not believe they
were thine own in faith i could not 

 nor other shouted dowley with sparkling eyes i was like
to lose my character the neighbors wending i had mayhap been
stealing it was a great day a great day one forgetteth not
days like that 

yes and his master was a fine man and prosperous and always
had a great feast of meat twice in the year and with it white
bread true wheaten bread in fact lived like a lord so to speak 
and in time dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter 

 and now consider what is come to pass said he impressively 
 two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table 
he made a pause here to let that fact sink home then added
 and eight times salt meat 

 it is even true said the wheelwright with bated breath 

 i know it of mine own knowledge said the mason in the same
reverent fashion 

 on my table appeareth white bread every sunday in the year 
added the master smith with solemnity i leave it to your own
consciences friends if this is not also true 

 by my head yes cried the mason 

 i can testify it and i do said the wheelwright 

 and as to furniture ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment
is he waved his hand in fine gesture of granting frank and
unhampered freedom of speech and added speak as ye are moved 
speak as ye would speak an i were not here 

 ye have five stools and of the sweetest workmanship at that albeit
your family is but three said the wheelwright with deep respect 

 and six wooden goblets and six platters of wood and two of pewter
to eat and drink from withal said the mason impressively and
i say it as knowing god is my judge and we tarry not here alway 
but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body 
be they false or be they sooth 

 now ye know what manner of man i am brother jones said the
smith with a fine and friendly condescension and doubtless ye
would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and
but sparing of outgo to strangers till their rating and quality be
assured but trouble yourself not as concerning that wit ye well
ye shall find me a man that regardeth not these matters but is
willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that carrieth
a right heart in his body be his worldly estate howsoever modest 
and in token of it here is my hand and i say with my own mouth
we are equals equals and he smiled around on the company with
the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious
thing and is quite well aware of it 

the king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance and
let go of it as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish all of which
had a good effect for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural
to one who was being called upon by greatness 

the dame brought out the table now and set it under the tree 
it caused a visible stir of surprise it being brand new and a
sumptuous article of deal but the surprise rose higher still
when the dame with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore 
but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity 
slowly unfolded an actual simon pure tablecloth and spread it 
that was a notch above even the blacksmiths domestic grandeurs 
and it hit him hard you could see it but marco was in paradise 
you could see that too then the dame brought two fine new
stools whew that was a sensation it was visible in the eyes of
every guest then she brought two more as calmly as she could 
sensation again with awed murmurs again she brought two
 walking on air she was so proud the guests were petrified and
the mason muttered 

 there is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence 

as the dame turned away marco couldnt help slapping on the climax
while the thing was hot so he said with what was meant for a
languid composure but was a poor imitation of it 

 these suffice leave the rest 

so there were more yet it was a fine effect i couldnt have
played the hand better myself 

from this out the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that
fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the
shade and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to
gasped ohs and ahs and mute upliftings of hands and eyes 
she fetched crockery new and plenty of it new wooden goblets
and other table furniture and beer fish chicken a goose eggs 
roast beef roast mutton a ham a small roast pig and a wealth
of genuine white wheaten bread take it by and large that spread
laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had
seen before and while they sat there just simply stupefied with
wonder and awe i sort of waved my hand as if by accident and
the storekeepers son emerged from space and said he had come
to collect 

 thats all right i said indifferently what is the amount 
give us the items 

then he read off this bill while those three amazed men listened 
and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate
waves of terror and admiration surged over marcos 

 pounds salt 
 dozen pints beer in the wood 
 bushels wheat 
 pounds fish 
 hens 
 goose 
 dozen eggs 
 roast of beef 
 roast of mutton 
 ham 
 sucking pig 
 crockery dinner sets 
 mens suits and underwear 
 stuff and linsey woolsey gown
 and underwear 
 wooden goblets 
 various table furniture 
 deal table 
 stools 
 miller guns loaded 

he ceased there was a pale and awful silence not a limb stirred 
not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath 

 is that all i asked in a voice of the most perfect calmness 

 all fair sir save that certain matters of light moment are
placed together under a head hight sundries if it would like
you i will sepa 

 it is of no consequence i said accompanying the words with
a gesture of the most utter indifference give me the grand
total please 

the clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself and said 

 thirty nine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays 

the wheelwright fell off his stool the others grabbed the table
to save themselves and there was a deep and general ejaculation of 

 god be with us in the day of disaster 

the clerk hastened to say 

 my father chargeth me to say he cannot honorably require you
to pay it all at this time and therefore only prayeth you 

i paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze but with an
air of indifference amounting almost to weariness got out my money
and tossed four dollars on to the table ah you should have seen
them stare 

the clerk was astonished and charmed he asked me to retain
one of the dollars as security until he could go to town and
 i interrupted 

 what and fetch back nine cents nonsense take the whole 
keep the change 

there was an amazed murmur to this effect 

 verily this being is made of money he throweth it away even
as if it were dirt 

the blacksmith was a crushed man 

the clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune i said
to marco and his wife 

 good folk here is a little trifle for you handing the miller guns
as if it were a matter of no consequence though each of them
contained fifteen cents in solid cash and while the poor creatures
went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude i turned to the
others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day 

 well if we are all ready i judge the dinner is come fall to 

ah well it was immense yes it was a daisy i dont know that
i ever put a situation together better or got happier spectacular
effects out of the materials available the blacksmith well he
was simply mashed land i wouldnt have felt what that man was
feeling for anything in the world here he had been blowing and
bragging about his grand meat feast twice a year and his fresh
meat twice a month and his salt meat twice a week and his white
bread every sunday the year round all for a family of three the
entire cost for the year not above sixty nine cents two
mills and six milrays and all of a sudden here comes along a man
who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blow out and not
only that but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small
sums yes dowley was a good deal wilted and shrunk up and
collapsed he had the aspect of a bladder balloon thats been
stepped on by a cow 



chapter xxxiii

sixth century political economy

however i made a dead set at him and before the first third
of the dinner was reached i had him happy again it was easy
to do in a country of ranks and castes you see in a country
where they have ranks and castes a man isnt ever a man he is
only part of a man he cant ever get his full growth you prove
your superiority over him in station or rank or fortune and
thats the end of it he knuckles down you cant insult him
after that no i dont mean quite that of course you can insult
him i only mean its difficult and so unless youve got a lot
of useless time on your hands it doesnt pay to try i had the
smiths reverence now because i was apparently immensely prosperous
and rich i could have had his adoration if i had had some little
gimcrack title of nobility and not only his but any commoners
in the land though he were the mightiest production of all the ages 
in intellect worth and character and i bankrupt in all three 
this was to remain so as long as england should exist in the
earth with the spirit of prophecy upon me i could look into
the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable
georges and other royal and noble clothes horses and leave unhonored
the creators of this world after god gutenburg watt arkwright 
whitney morse stephenson bell 

the king got his cargo aboard and then the talk not turning upon
battle conquest or iron clad duel he dulled down to drowsiness
and went off to take a nap mrs marco cleared the table placed
the beer keg handy and went away to eat her dinner of leavings
in humble privacy and the rest of us soon drifted into matters
near and dear to the hearts of our sort business and wages 
of course at a first glance things appeared to be exceeding
prosperous in this little tributary kingdom whose lord was
king bagdemagus as compared with the state of things in my own
region they had the protection system in full force here 
whereas we were working along down toward free trade by easy
stages and were now about half way before long dowley and i
were doing all the talking the others hungrily listening dowley
warmed to his work snuffed an advantage in the air and began
to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me 
and they did have something of that look 

 in your country brother what is the wage of a master bailiff 
master hind carter shepherd swineherd 

 twenty five milrays a day that is to say a quarter of a cent 

the smiths face beamed with joy he said 

 with us they are allowed the double of it and what may a mechanic
get carpenter dauber mason painter blacksmith wheelwright 
and the like 

 on the average fifty milrays half a cent a day 

 ho ho with us they are allowed a hundred with us any good
mechanic is allowed a cent a day i count out the tailor but
not the others they are all allowed a cent a day and in driving
times they get more yes up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen
milrays a day ive paid a hundred and fifteen myself within
the week rah for protection to sheol with free trade 

and his face shone upon the company like a sunburst but i didnt
scare at all i rigged up my pile driver and allowed myself
fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth drive him all in
 drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show
above ground here is the way i started in on him i asked 

 what do you pay a pound for salt 

 a hundred milrays 

 we pay forty what do you pay for beef and mutton when you
buy it that was a neat hit it made the color come 

 it varieth somewhat but not much one may say seventy five milrays
the pound 

 we pay thirty three what do you pay for eggs 

 fifty milrays the dozen 

 we pay twenty what do you pay for beer 

 it costeth us eight and one half milrays the pint 

 we get it for four twenty five bottles for a cent 
what do you pay for wheat 

 at the rate of nine hundred milrays the bushel 

 we pay four hundred what do you pay for a mans tow linen suit 

 thirteen cents 

 we pay six what do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the
laborer or the mechanic 

 we pay eight cents four mills 

 well observe the difference you pay eight cents and four mills 
we pay only four cents i prepared now to sock it to him i said 
 look here dear friend whats become of your high wages you
were bragging so about a few minutes ago and i looked around
on the company with placid satisfaction for i had slipped up
on him gradually and tied him hand and foot you see without his
ever noticing that he was being tied at all whats become of
those noble high wages of yours i seem to have knocked the
stuffing all out of them it appears to me 

but if you will believe me he merely looked surprised that
is all he didnt grasp the situation at all didnt know he had
walked into a trap didnt discover that he was in a trap i could
have shot him from sheer vexation with cloudy eye and a struggling
intellect he fetched this out 

 marry i seem not to understand it is proved that our wages
be double thine how then may it be that thoust knocked therefrom
the stuffing an miscall not the wonderly word this being the
first time under grace and providence of god it hath been granted
me to hear it 

well i was stunned partly with this unlooked for stupidity on
his part and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with
him and were of his mind if you might call it mind my position
was simple enough plain enough how could it ever be simplified
more however i must try 

 why look here brother dowley dont you see your wages are
merely higher than ours in name not in fact 

 hear him they are the double ye have confessed it yourself 

 yes yes i dont deny that at all but thats got nothing to do
with it the amount of the wages in mere coins with meaningless
names attached to them to know them by has got nothing to do
with it the thing is how much can you buy with your wages 
 thats the idea while it is true that with you a good mechanic
is allowed about three dollars and a half a year and with us only
about a dollar and seventy five 

 there yere confessing it again yere confessing it again 

 confound it ive never denied it i tell you what i say is
this with us half a dollar buys more than a dollar buys
with you and therefore it stands to reason and the commonest
kind of common sense that our wages are higher than yours 

he looked dazed and said despairingly 

 verily i cannot make it out yeve just said ours are the
higher and with the same breath ye take it back 

 oh great scott isnt it possible to get such a simple thing
through your head now look here let me illustrate we pay
four cents for a womans stuff gown you pay which is
four mills more than double what do you allow a laboring
woman who works on a farm 

 two mills a day 

 very good we allow but half as much we pay her only a tenth
of a cent a day and 

 again yere conf 

 wait now you see the thing is very simple this time youll
understand it for instance it takes your woman days to earn
her gown at mills a day weeks work but ours earns hers
in forty days two days short of weeks your woman has a gown 
and her whole seven weeks wages are gone ours has a gown and
two days wages left to buy something else with there now 
you understand it 

he looked well he merely looked dubious its the most i can say 
so did the others i waited to let the thing work dowley spoke
at last and betrayed the fact that he actually hadnt gotten away
from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet he said with
a trifle of hesitancy 

 but but ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better
than one 

shucks well of course i hated to give it up so i chanced
another flyer 

 let us suppose a case suppose one of your journeymen goes out
and buys the following articles 

 pound of salt 
 dozen eggs 
 dozen pints of beer 
 bushel of wheat 
 tow linen suit 
 pounds of beef 
 pounds of mutton 

 the lot will cost him cents it takes him working days
to earn the money weeks and days let him come to us and
work days at half the wages he can buy all those things for
a shade under cents they will cost him a shade under 
days work and he will have about half a weeks wages over carry
it through the year he would save nearly a weeks wages every
two months your man nothing thus saving five or six weeks wages
in a year your man not a cent now i reckon you understand that
high wages and low wages are phrases that dont mean anything
in the world until you find out which of them will buy the most 

it was a crusher 

but alas it didnt crush no i had to give it up what those
people valued was high wages it didnt seem to be a matter of
any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything
or not they stood for protection and swore by it which was
reasonable enough because interested parties had gulled them into
the notion that it was protection which had created their high
wages i proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages
had advanced but per cent while the cost of living had gone
up and that with us in a shorter time wages had advanced
 per cent while the cost of living had gone steadily down but
it didnt do any good nothing could unseat their strange beliefs 

well i was smarting under a sense of defeat undeserved defeat 
but what of that that didnt soften the smart any and to think
of the circumstances the first statesman of the age the capablest
man the best informed man in the entire world the loftiest
uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political
firmament for centuries sitting here apparently defeated in
argument by an ignorant country blacksmith and i could see that
those others were sorry for me which made me blush till i could
smell my whiskers scorching put yourself in my place feel as mean
as i did as ashamed as i felt wouldnt you have struck below the
belt to get even yes you would it is simply human nature 
well that is what i did i am not trying to justify it im only
saying that i was mad and anybody would have done it 

well when i make up my mind to hit a man i dont plan out
a love tap no that isnt my way as long as im going to hit him
at all im going to hit him a lifter and i dont jump at him
all of a sudden and risk making a blundering half way business
of it no i get away off yonder to one side and work up on him
gradually so that he never suspects that im going to hit him
at all and by and by all in a flash hes flat on his back and
he cant tell for the life of him how it all happened that is
the way i went for brother dowley i started to talking lazy and
comfortable as if i was just talking to pass the time and the
oldest man in the world couldnt have taken the bearings of my
starting place and guessed where i was going to fetch up 

 boys theres a good many curious things about law and custom 
and usage and all that sort of thing when you come to look at it 
yes and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement 
too there are written laws they perish but there are also
unwritten laws they are eternal take the unwritten law of wages 
it says theyve got to advance little by little straight through
the centuries and notice how it works we know what wages are
now here and there and yonder we strike an average and say thats
the wages of to day we know what the wages were a hundred years
ago and what they were two hundred years ago thats as far back
as we can get but it suffices to give us the law of progress 
the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation and so without
a document to help us we can come pretty close to determining
what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago 
good so far do we stop there no we stop looking backward 
we face around and apply the law to the future my friends i can
tell you what peoples wages are going to be at any date in the
future you want to know for hundreds and hundreds of years 

 what goodman what 

 yes in seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times
what they are now here in your region and farm hands will be
allowed cents a day and mechanics 

 i wouldt i might die now and live then interrupted smug the
wheelwright with a fine avaricious glow in his eye 

 and that isnt all theyll get their board besides such as it is 
it wont bloat them two hundred and fifty years later pay attention
now a mechanics wages will be mind you this is law not
guesswork a mechanics wages will then be twenty cents a day 

there was a general gasp of awed astonishment dickon the mason
murmured with raised eyes and hands 

 more than three weeks pay for one days work 

 riches of a truth yes riches muttered marco his breath
coming quick and short with excitement 

 wages will keep on rising little by little little by little 
as steadily as a tree grows and at the end of three hundred and
forty years more therell be at least one country where the
mechanics average wage will be two hundred cents a day 

it knocked them absolutely dumb not a man of them could get
his breath for upwards of two minutes then the coal burner
said prayerfully 

 might i but live to see it 

 it is the income of an earl said smug 

 an earl say ye said dowley ye could say more than that and
speak no lie theres no earl in the realm of bagdemagus that hath
an income like to that income of an earl mf its the income
of an angel 

 now then that is what is going to happen as regards wages 
in that remote day that man will earn with one weeks work 
that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of fifty weeks to
earn now some other pretty surprising things are going to happen 
too brother dowley who is it that determines every spring 
what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic laborer and
servant shall be for that year 

 sometimes the courts sometimes the town council but most of all 
the magistrate ye may say in general terms it is the magistrate
that fixes the wages 

 doesnt ask any of those poor devils to help him fix their wages
for them does he 

 hm that were an idea the master thats to pay him the money
is the one thats rightly concerned in that matter ye will notice 

 yes but i thought the other man might have some little trifle
at stake in it too and even his wife and children poor creatures 
the masters are these nobles rich men the prosperous generally 
these few who do no work determine what pay the vast hive shall
have who do work you see theyre a combine a trade union 
to coin a new phrase who band themselves together to force their
lowly brother to take what they choose to give thirteen hundred
years hence so says the unwritten law the combine will be the
other way and then how these fine peoples posterity will fume
and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade
unions yes indeed the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the
wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century and
then all of a sudden the wage earner will consider that a couple
of thousand years or so is enough of this one sided sort of thing 
and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself 
ah he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation
to settle 

 do ye believe 

 that he actually will help to fix his own wages yes indeed 
and he will be strong and able then 

 brave times brave times of a truth sneered the prosperous smith 

 oh and theres another detail in that day a master may hire
a man for only just one day or one week or one month at a time 
if he wants to 

 what 

 its true moreover a magistrate wont be able to force a man
to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man
wants to or not 

 will there be no law or sense in that day 

 both of them dowley in that day a man will be his own property 
not the property of magistrate and master and he can leave town
whenever he wants to if the wages dont suit him and they cant
put him in the pillory for it 

 perdition catch such an age shouted dowley in strong indignation 
 an age of dogs an age barren of reverence for superiors and
respect for authority the pillory 

 oh wait brother say no good word for that institution i think
the pillory ought to be abolished 

 a most strange idea why 

 well ill tell you why is a man ever put in the pillory for
a capital crime 

 no 

 is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small
offense and then kill him 

there was no answer i had scored my first point for the first
time the smith wasnt up and ready the company noticed it 
good effect 

 you dont answer brother you were about to glorify the pillory
a while ago and shed some pity on a future age that isnt going
to use it i think the pillory ought to be abolished what
usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some
little offense that didnt amount to anything in the world the
mob try to have some fun with him dont they 

 yes 

 they begin by clodding him and they laugh themselves to pieces
to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another 

 yes 

 then they throw dead cats at him dont they 

 yes 

 well then suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob
and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against
him and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community 
for his pride or his prosperity or one thing or another stones
and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently dont they 

 there is no doubt of it 

 as a rule he is crippled for life isnt he jaws broken teeth
smashed out or legs mutilated gangrened presently cut off 
 or an eye knocked out maybe both eyes 

 it is true god knoweth it 

 and if he is unpopular he can depend on dying right there in
the stocks cant he 

 he surely can one may not deny it 

 i take it none of you are unpopular by reason of pride or
insolence or conspicuous prosperity or any of those things that
excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village you 
wouldnt think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks 

dowley winced visibly i judged he was hit but he didnt betray
it by any spoken word as for the others they spoke out plainly 
and with strong feeling they said they had seen enough of the
stocks to know what a mans chance in them was and they would
never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick
death by hanging 

 well to change the subject for i think ive established my
point that the stocks ought to be abolished i think some of our
laws are pretty unfair for instance if i do a thing which ought
to deliver me to the stocks and you know i did it and yet keep
still and dont report me you will get the stocks if anybody
informs on you 

 ah but that would serve you but right said dowley for you
 must inform so saith the law 

the others coincided 

 well all right let it go since you vote me down but theres
one thing which certainly isnt fair the magistrate fixes a
mechanics wage at one cent a day for instance the law says that
if any master shall venture even under utmost press of business 
to pay anything over that cent a day even for a single day he
shall be both fined and pilloried for it and whoever knows he did
it and doesnt inform they also shall be fined and pilloried now
it seems to me unfair dowley and a deadly peril to all of us 
that because you thoughtlessly confessed a while ago that within
a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil 

oh i tell you it was a smasher you ought to have seen them to
go to pieces the whole gang i had just slipped up on poor
smiling and complacent dowley so nice and easy and softly that
he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow
came crashing down and knocked him all to rags 

a fine effect in fact as fine as any i ever produced with so
little time to work it up in 

but i saw in a moment that i had overdone the thing a little 
i was expecting to scare them but i wasnt expecting to scare
them to death they were mighty near it though you see they
had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory and
to have that thing staring them in the face and every one of them
distinctly at the mercy of me a stranger if i chose to go and
report well it was awful and they couldnt seem to recover
from the shock they couldnt seem to pull themselves together 
pale shaky dumb pitiful why they werent any better than
so many dead men it was very uncomfortable of course i thought
they would appeal to me to keep mum and then we would shake hands 
and take a drink all round and laugh it off and there an end 
but no you see i was an unknown person among a cruelly oppressed
and suspicious people a people always accustomed to having advantage
taken of their helplessness and never expecting just or kind
treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates 
appeal to me to be gentle to be fair to be generous of course 
they wanted to but they couldnt dare 



chapter xxxiv

the yankee and the king sold as slaves

well what had i better do nothing in a hurry sure i must
get up a diversion anything to employ me while i could think 
and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life
again there sat marco petrified in the act of trying to get
the hang of his miller gun turned to stone just in the attitude
he was in when my pile driver fell the toy still gripped in his
unconscious fingers so i took it from him and proposed to explain
its mystery mystery a simple little thing like that and yet it
was mysterious enough for that race and that age 

i never saw such an awkward people with machinery you see they
were totally unused to it the miller gun was a little double barreled
tube of toughened glass with a neat little trick of a spring
to it which upon pressure would let a shot escape but the shot
wouldnt hurt anybody it would only drop into your hand in the
gun were two sizes wee mustard seed shot and another sort that
were several times larger they were money the mustard seed
shot represented milrays the larger ones mills so the gun was
a purse and very handy too you could pay out money in the dark
with it with accuracy and you could carry it in your mouth or
in your vest pocket if you had one i made them of several sizes
 one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar 
using shot for money was a good thing for the government the metal
cost nothing and the money couldnt be counterfeited for i was
the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower 
 paying the shot soon came to be a common phrase yes and i knew
it would still be passing mens lips away down in the nineteenth
century yet none would suspect how and when it originated 

the king joined us about this time mightily refreshed by his nap 
and feeling good anything could make me nervous now i was so
uneasy for our lives were in danger and so it worried me to
detect a complacent something in the kings eye which seemed to
indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance
of some kind or other confound it why must he go and choose
such a time as this 

i was right he began straight off in the most innocently
artful and transparent and lubberly way to lead up to the
subject of agriculture the cold sweat broke out all over me 
i wanted to whisper in his ear man we are in awful danger 
every moment is worth a principality till we get back these mens
confidence dont waste any of this golden time but of course
i couldnt do it whisper to him it would look as if we were
conspiring so i had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while
the king stood over that dynamite mine and mooned along about his
damned onions and things at first the tumult of my own thoughts 
summoned by the danger signal and swarming to the rescue from
every quarter of my skull kept up such a hurrah and confusion
and fifing and drumming that i couldnt take in a word but
presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystallize
and fall into position and form line of battle a sort of order and
quiet ensued and i caught the boom of the kings batteries as if
out of remote distance 

 were not the best way methinks albeit it is not to be denied
that authorities differ as concerning this point some contending
that the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early
from the tree 

the audience showed signs of life and sought each others eyes
in a surprised and troubled way 

 whileas others do yet maintain with much show of reason that
this is not of necessity the case instancing that plums and other
like cereals do be always dug in the unripe state 

the audience exhibited distinct distress yes and also fear 

 yet are they clearly wholesome the more especially when one
doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the
tranquilizing juice of the wayward cabbage 

the wild light of terror began to glow in these mens eyes and
one of them muttered these be errors every one god hath surely
smitten the mind of this farmer i was in miserable apprehension 
i sat upon thorns 

 and further instancing the known truth that in the case of
animals the young which may be called the green fruit of the
creature is the better all confessing that when a goat is ripe 
his fur doth heat and sore engame his flesh the which defect 
taken in connection with his several rancid habits and fulsome
appetites and godless attitudes of mind and bilious quality
of morals 

they rose and went for him with a fierce shout the one would
betray us the other is mad kill them kill them they flung
themselves upon us what joy flamed up in the kings eye he
might be lame in agriculture but this kind of thing was just in
his line he had been fasting long he was hungry for a fight 
he hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear
off his feet and stretched him flat on his back st george for
britain and he downed the wheelwright the mason was big but
i laid him out like nothing the three gathered themselves up and
came again went down again came again and kept on repeating
this with native british pluck until they were battered to jelly 
reeling with exhaustion and so blind that they couldnt tell us
from each other and yet they kept right on hammering away with
what might was left in them hammering each other for we stepped
aside and looked on while they rolled and struggled and gouged 
and pounded and bit with the strict and wordless attention to
business of so many bulldogs we looked on without apprehension 
for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us 
and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe
from intrusion 

well while they were gradually playing out it suddenly occurred
to me to wonder what had become of marco i looked around he
was nowhere to be seen oh but this was ominous i pulled the
kings sleeve and we glided away and rushed for the hut no marco
there no phyllis there they had gone to the road for help sure 
i told the king to give his heels wings and i would explain later 
we made good time across the open ground and as we darted into
the shelter of the wood i glanced back and saw a mob of excited
peasants swarm into view with marco and his wife at their head 
they were making a world of noise but that couldnt hurt anybody 
the wood was dense and as soon as we were well into its depths
we would take to a tree and let them whistle ah but then came
another sound dogs yes that was quite another matter it
magnified our contract we must find running water 

we tore along at a good gait and soon left the sounds far behind
and modified to a murmur we struck a stream and darted into it 
we waded swiftly down it in the dim forest light for as much
as three hundred yards and then came across an oak with a great
bough sticking out over the water we climbed up on this bough 
and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree now
we began to hear those sounds more plainly so the mob had struck
our trail for a while the sounds approached pretty fast and
then for another while they didnt no doubt the dogs had found
the place where we had entered the stream and were now waltzing
up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again 

when we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage 
the king was satisfied but i was doubtful i believed we could
crawl along a branch and get into the next tree and i judged it
worth while to try we tried it and made a success of it though
the king slipped at the junction and came near failing to connect 
we got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among
the foliage and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt 

presently we heard it coming and coming on the jump too yes 
and down both sides of the stream louder louder next minute
it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings barkings tramplings 
and swept by like a cyclone 

 i was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something
to them said i but i dont mind the disappointment come 
my liege it were well that we make good use of our time weve
flanked them dark is coming on presently if we can cross the
stream and get a good start and borrow a couple of horses from
somebodys pasture to use for a few hours we shall be safe enough 

we started down and got nearly to the lowest limb when we seemed
to hear the hunt returning we stopped to listen 

 yes said i theyre baffled theyve given it up theyre on
their way home we will climb back to our roost again and let
them go by 

so we climbed back the king listened a moment and said 

 they still search i wit the sign we did best to abide 

he was right he knew more about hunting than i did the noise
approached steadily but not with a rush the king said 

 they reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them 
and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took
the water 

 yes sire that is about it i am afraid though i was hoping
better things 

the noise drew nearer and nearer and soon the van was drifting
under us on both sides of the water a voice called a halt from
the other bank and said 

 an they were so minded they could get to yon tree by this branch
that overhangs and yet not touch ground ye will do well to send
a man up it 

 marry that we will do 

i was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing
and swapping trees to beat it but dont you know there are
some things that can beat smartness and foresight awkwardness
and stupidity can the best swordsman in the world doesnt need
to fear the second best swordsman in the world no the person
for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never
had a sword in his hand before he doesnt do the thing he ought
to do and so the expert isnt prepared for him he does the thing
he ought not to do and often it catches the expert out and ends
him on the spot well how could i with all my gifts make any
valuable preparation against a near sighted cross eyed pudding headed
clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right
one and that is what he did he went for the wrong tree which
was of course the right one by mistake and up he started 

matters were serious now we remained still and awaited developments 
the peasant toiled his difficult way up the king raised himself
up and stood he made a leg ready and when the comers head
arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud and down went the man
floundering to the ground there was a wild outbreak of anger
below and the mob swarmed in from all around and there we were
treed and prisoners another man started up the bridging bough
was detected and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished
the bridge the king ordered me to play horatius and keep the
bridge for a while the enemy came thick and fast but no matter 
the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged
him as soon as he came in reach the kings spirits rose his joy
was limitless he said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect
we should have a beautiful night for on this line of tactics we
could hold the tree against the whole country side 

however the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves wherefore
they called off the assault and began to debate other plans 
they had no weapons but there were plenty of stones and stones
might answer we had no objections a stone might possibly
penetrate to us once in a while but it wasnt very likely we were
well protected by boughs and foliage and were not visible from
any good aiming point if they would but waste half an hour in
stone throwing the dark would come to our help we were feeling
very well satisfied we could smile almost laugh 

but we didnt which was just as well for we should have been
interrupted before the stones had been raging through the leaves
and bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes we began to notice
a smell a couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation
 it was smoke our game was up at last we recognized that when
smoke invites you you have to come they raised their pile of
dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher and when they saw
the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree they broke
out in a storm of joy clamors i got enough breath to say 

 proceed my liege after you is manners 

the king gasped 

 follow me down and then back thyself against one side of the
trunk and leave me the other then will we fight let each pile
his dead according to his own fashion and taste 

then he descended barking and coughing and i followed i struck
the ground an instant after him we sprang to our appointed places 
and began to give and take with all our might the powwow and
racket were prodigious it was a tempest of riot and confusion and
thick falling blows suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst
of the crowd and a voice shouted 

 hold or ye are dead men 

how good it sounded the owner of the voice bore all the marks of
a gentleman picturesque and costly raiment the aspect of command 
a hard countenance with complexion and features marred by dissipation 
the mob fell humbly back like so many spaniels the gentleman
inspected us critically then said sharply to the peasants 

 what are ye doing to these people 

 they be madmen worshipful sir that have come wandering we know
not whence and 

 ye know not whence do ye pretend ye know them not 

 most honored sir we speak but the truth they are strangers
and unknown to any in this region and they be the most violent
and bloodthirsty madmen that ever 

 peace ye know not what ye say they are not mad who are ye 
and whence are ye explain 

 we are but peaceful strangers sir i said and traveling upon
our own concerns we are from a far country and unacquainted
here we have purposed no harm and yet but for your brave
interference and protection these people would have killed us 
as you have divined sir we are not mad neither are we violent
or bloodthirsty 

the gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly lash me
these animals to their kennels 

the mob vanished in an instant and after them plunged the horsemen 
laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down such
as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the
bush the shrieks and supplications presently died away in the
distance and soon the horsemen began to straggle back meantime
the gentleman had been questioning us more closely but had dug
no particulars out of us we were lavish of recognition of the
service he was doing us but we revealed nothing more than that we
were friendless strangers from a far country when the escort were
all returned the gentleman said to one of his servants 

 bring the led horses and mount these people 

 yes my lord 

we were placed toward the rear among the servants we traveled
pretty fast and finally drew rein some time after dark at a
roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our
troubles my lord went immediately to his room after ordering
his supper and we saw no more of him at dawn in the morning
we breakfasted and made ready to start 

my lords chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with
indolent grace and said 

 ye have said ye should continue upon this road which is our
direction likewise wherefore my lord the earl grip hath given
commandment that ye retain the horses and ride and that certain
of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight cambenet 
whenso ye shall be out of peril 

we could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the
offer we jogged along six in the party at a moderate and
comfortable gait and in conversation learned that my lord grip
was a very great personage in his own region which lay a days
journey beyond cambenet we loitered to such a degree that it was
near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square
of the town we dismounted and left our thanks once more for
my lord and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of
the square to see what might be the object of interest it was the
remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves so they had
been dragging their chains about all this weary time that poor
husband was gone and also many others and some few purchases
had been added to the gang the king was not interested and
wanted to move along but i was absorbed and full of pity i could
not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity 
there they sat grounded upon the ground silent uncomplaining 
with bowed heads a pathetic sight and by hideous contrast a
redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty
steps away in fulsome laudation of our glorious british liberties 

i was boiling i had forgotten i was a plebeian i was remembering
i was a man cost what it might i would mount that rostrum and 

click the king and i were handcuffed together our companions 
those servants had done it my lord grip stood looking on the
king burst out in a fury and said 

 what meaneth this ill mannered jest 

my lord merely said to his head miscreant coolly 

 put up the slaves and sell them 

 slaves the word had a new sound and how unspeakably awful the
king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly force 
but my lord was out of the way when they arrived a dozen of
the rascals servants sprang forward and in a moment we were
helpless with our hands bound behind us we so loudly and so
earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen that we got the interested
attention of that liberty mouthing orator and his patriotic crowd 
and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude 
the orator said 

 if indeed ye are freemen ye have nought to fear the god given
liberties of britain are about ye for your shield and shelter 
 applause ye shall soon see bring forth your proofs 

 what proofs 

 proof that ye are freemen 

ah i remembered i came to myself i said nothing but the
king stormed out 

 thourt insane man it were better and more in reason that
this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are not freemen 

you see he knew his own laws just as other people so often know
the laws by words not by effects they take a meaning and get
to be very vivid when you come to apply them to yourself 

all hands shook their heads and looked disappointed some turned
away no longer interested the orator said and this time in the
tones of business not of sentiment 

 an ye do not know your countrys laws it were time ye learned
them ye are strangers to us ye will not deny that ye may be
freemen we do not deny that but also ye may be slaves the law
is clear it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves 
it requireth you to prove ye are not 

i said 

 dear sir give us only time to send to astolat or give us only
time to send to the valley of holiness 

 peace good man these are extraordinary requests and you may
not hope to have them granted it would cost much time and would
unwarrantably inconvenience your master 

 master idiot stormed the king i have no master i myself
am the m 

 silence for gods sake 

i got the words out in time to stop the king we were in trouble
enough already it could not help us any to give these people
the notion that we were lunatics 

there is no use in stringing out the details the earl put us up
and sold us at auction this same infernal law had existed in
our own south in my own time more than thirteen hundred years
later and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that
they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without
the circumstance making any particular impression upon me but the
minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience 
a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly
hellish well thats the way we are made 

yes we were sold at auction like swine in a big town and an
active market we should have brought a good price but this place
was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me
ashamed every time i think of it the king of england brought
seven dollars and his prime minister nine whereas the king was
easily worth twelve dollars and i as easily worth fifteen but
that is the way things always go if you force a sale on a dull
market i dont care what the property is you are going to make
a poor business of it and you can make up your mind to it if
the earl had had wit enough to 

however there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up
on his account let him go for the present i took his number 
so to speak 

the slave dealer bought us both and hitched us onto that long
chain of his and we constituted the rear of his procession we
took up our line of march and passed out of cambenet at noon 
and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the king
of england and his chief minister marching manacled and fettered
and yoked in a slave convoy could move by all manner of idle men
and women and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely 
and yet never attract a curious eye never provoke a single remark 
dear dear it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king
than there is about a tramp after all he is just a cheap and
hollow artificiality when you dont know he is a king but reveal
his quality and dear me it takes your very breath away to look
at him i reckon we are all fools born so no doubt 



chapter xxxv

a pitiful incident

its a world of surprises the king brooded this was natural 
what would he brood about should you say why about the prodigious
nature of his fall of course from the loftiest place in the world
to the lowest from the most illustrious station in the world to
the obscurest from the grandest vocation among men to the basest 
no i take my oath that the thing that graveled him most to start
with was not this but the price he had fetched he couldnt
seem to get over that seven dollars well it stunned me so when
i first found it out that i couldnt believe it it didnt seem
natural but as soon as my mental sight cleared and i got a right
focus on it i saw i was mistaken it was natural for this
reason a king is a mere artificiality and so a kings feelings 
like the impulses of an automatic doll are mere artificialities 
but as a man he is a reality and his feelings as a man are
real not phantoms it shames the average man to be valued below
his own estimate of his worth and the king certainly wasnt
anything more than an average man if he was up that high 

confound him he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything
like a fair market he would have fetched twenty five dollars 
sure a thing which was plainly nonsense and full or the baldest
conceit i wasnt worth it myself but it was tender ground for
me to argue on in fact i had to simply shirk argument and do
the diplomatic instead i had to throw conscience aside and
brazenly concede that he ought to have brought twenty five dollars 
whereas i was quite well aware that in all the ages the world had
never seen a king that was worth half the money and during the
next thirteen centuries wouldnt see one that was worth the fourth
of it yes he tired me if he began to talk about the crops 
or about the recent weather or about the condition of politics 
or about dogs or cats or morals or theology no matter what
 i sighed for i knew what was coming he was going to get out of it
a palliation of that tiresome seven dollar sale wherever we
halted where there was a crowd he would give me a look which
said plainly if that thing could be tried over again now with
this kind of folk you would see a different result well when
he was first sold it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven
dollars but before he was done with his sweating and worrying
i wished he had fetched a hundred the thing never got a chance
to die for every day at one place or another possible purchasers
looked us over and as often as any other way their comment on
the king was something like this 

 heres a two dollar and a half chump with a thirty dollar style 
pity but style was marketable 

at last this sort of remark produced an evil result our owner
was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be
mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king so he went
to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty i could have
given the man some valuable advice but i didnt you mustnt
volunteer advice to a slave driver unless you want to damage
the cause you are arguing for i had found it a sufficiently
difficult job to reduce the kings style to a peasants style 
even when he was a willing and anxious pupil now then to undertake
to reduce the kings style to a slaves style and by force go to 
it was a stately contract never mind the details it will save me
trouble to let you imagine them i will only remark that at the
end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club
and fist had done their work well the kings body was a sight
to see and to weep over but his spirit why it wasnt even
phased even that dull clod of a slave driver was able to see
that there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man
till he dies whose bones you can break but whose manhood you
cant this man found that from his first effort down to his
latest he couldnt ever come within reach of the king but the
king was ready to plunge for him and did it so he gave up
at last and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired 
the fact is the king was a good deal more than a king he was
a man and when a man is a man you cant knock it out of him 

we had a rough time for a month tramping to and fro in the earth 
and suffering and what englishman was the most interested in
the slavery question by that time his grace the king yes from
being the most indifferent he was become the most interested 
he was become the bitterest hater of the institution i had ever
heard talk and so i ventured to ask once more a question which
i had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that
i had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further 
would he abolish slavery 

his answer was as sharp as before but it was music this time 
i shouldnt ever wish to hear pleasanter though the profanity
was not good being awkwardly put together and with the crash word
almost in the middle instead of at the end where of course it
ought to have been 

i was ready and willing to get free now i hadnt wanted to get
free any sooner no i cannot quite say that i had wanted to 
but i had not been willing to take desperate chances and had
always dissuaded the king from them but now ah it was a new
atmosphere liberty would be worth any cost that might be put
upon it now i set about a plan and was straightway charmed
with it it would require time yes and patience too a great
deal of both one could invent quicker ways and fully as sure
ones but none that would be as picturesque as this none that
could be made so dramatic and so i was not going to give this
one up it might delay us months but no matter i would carry
it out or break something 

now and then we had an adventure one night we were overtaken
by a snow storm while still a mile from the village we were making
for almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog the driving
snow was so thick you couldnt see a thing and we were soon
lost the slave driver lashed us desperately for he saw ruin
before him but his lashings only made matters worse for they
drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor 
so we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we
were the storm continued until toward midnight then ceased 
by this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were
dead and others past moving and threatened with death our
master was nearly beside himself he stirred up the living and
made us stand jump slap ourselves to restore our circulation 
and he helped as well as he could with his whip 

now came a diversion we heard shrieks and yells and soon a
woman came running and crying and seeing our group she flung
herself into our midst and begged for protection a mob of people
came tearing after her some with torches and they said she was a
witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease 
and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black
cat this poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked
human she was so battered and bloody the mob wanted to burn her 

well now what do you suppose our master did when we closed
around this poor creature to shelter her he saw his chance he
said burn her here or they shouldnt have her at all imagine
that they were willing they fastened her to a post they
brought wood and piled it about her they applied the torch while
she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters
to her breast and our brute with a heart solely for business 
lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life
and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent
life of that poor harmless mother that was the sort of master we
had i took his number that snow storm cost him nine of his
flock and he was more brutal to us than ever after that for
many days together he was so enraged over his loss 

we had adventures all along one day we ran into a procession 
and such a procession all the riffraff of the kingdom seemed
to be comprehended in it and all drunk at that in the van was
a cart with a coffin in it and on the coffin sat a comely young
girl of about eighteen suckling a baby which she squeezed to her
breast in a passion of love every little while and every little
while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down
upon it and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her 
happy and content kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand 
which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart 

men and women boys and girls trotted along beside or after
the cart hooting shouting profane and ribald remarks singing
snatches of foul song skipping dancing a very holiday of
hellions a sickening sight we had struck a suburb of london 
outside the walls and this was a sample of one sort of london
society our master secured a good place for us near the gallows 
a priest was in attendance and he helped the girl climb up and
said comforting words to her and made the under sheriff provide
a stool for her then he stood there by her on the gallows and
for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his
feet then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away
on every side occupying the vacancies far and near and then began
to tell the story of the case and there was pity in his voice
 how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land 
i remember every detail of what he said except the words he said
it in and so i change it into my own words 

 law is intended to mete out justice sometimes it fails this
cannot be helped we can only grieve and be resigned and pray
for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law and
that his fellows may be few a law sends this poor young thing
to death and it is right but another law had placed her where
she must commit her crime or starve with her child and before god
that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death 

 a little while ago this young thing this child of eighteen years 
was as happy a wife and mother as any in england and her lips
were blithe with song which is the native speech of glad and
innocent hearts her young husband was as happy as she for he was
doing his whole duty he worked early and late at his handicraft 
his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned he was prospering 
he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family he was
adding his mite to the wealth of the nation by consent of a
treacherous law instant destruction fell upon this holy home and
swept it away that young husband was waylaid and impressed 
and sent to sea the wife knew nothing of it she sought him
everywhere she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications
of her tears the broken eloquence of her despair weeks dragged
by she watching waiting hoping her mind going slowly to wreck
under the burden of her misery little by little all her small
possessions went for food when she could no longer pay her rent 
they turned her out of doors she begged while she had strength 
when she was starving at last and her milk failing she stole a
piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent 
thinking to sell it and save her child but she was seen by the
owner of the cloth she was put in jail and brought to trial 
the man testified to the facts a plea was made for her and her
sorrowful story was told in her behalf she spoke too by
permission and said she did steal the cloth but that her mind
was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne
with hunger all acts criminal or other swam meaningless through
her brain and she knew nothing rightly except that she was so
hungry for a moment all were touched and there was disposition
to deal mercifully with her seeing that she was so young and
friendless and her case so piteous and the law that robbed her
of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her
transgression but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas
these things were all true and most pitiful as well still there
was much small theft in these days and mistimed mercy here would
be a danger to property oh my god is there no property in ruined
homes and orphaned babes and broken hearts that british law
holds precious and so he must require sentence 

 when the judge put on his black cap the owner of the stolen
linen rose trembling up his lip quivering his face as gray as
ashes and when the awful words came he cried out oh poor
child poor child i did not know it was death and fell as a
tree falls when they lifted him up his reason was gone before
the sun was set he had taken his own life a kindly man a man
whose heart was right at bottom add his murder to this that
is to be now done here and charge them both where they belong
 to the rulers and the bitter laws of britain the time is come my
child let me pray over thee not for thee dear abused poor heart
and innocent but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death 
who need it more 

after his prayer they put the noose around the young girls neck 
and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear 
because she was devouring the baby all the time wildly kissing it 
and snatching it to her face and her breast and drenching it
with tears and half moaning half shrieking all the while and the
baby crowing and laughing and kicking its feet with delight over
what it took for romp and play even the hangman couldnt stand it 
but turned away when all was ready the priest gently pulled and
tugged and forced the child out of the mothers arms and stepped
quickly out of her reach but she clasped her hands and made a
wild spring toward him with a shriek but the rope and the
under sheriff held her short then she went on her knees and
stretched out her hands and cried 

 one more kiss oh my god one more one more it is the dying
that begs it 

she got it she almost smothered the little thing and when they
got it away again she cried out 

 oh my child my darling it will die it has no home it has
no father no friend no mother 

 it has them all said that good priest all these will i be
to it till i die 

you should have seen her face then gratitude lord what do
you want with words to express that words are only painted fire 
a look is the fire itself she gave that look and carried it away
to the treasury of heaven where all things that are divine belong 



chapter xxxvi

an encounter in the dark

london to a slave was a sufficiently interesting place it was
merely a great big village and mainly mud and thatch the streets
were muddy crooked unpaved the populace was an ever flocking
and drifting swarm of rags and splendors of nodding plumes and
shining armor the king had a palace there he saw the outside
of it it made him sigh yes and swear a little in a poor
juvenile sixth century way we saw knights and grandees whom
we knew but they didnt know us in our rags and dirt and raw
welts and bruises and wouldnt have recognized us if we had hailed
them nor stopped to answer either it being unlawful to speak
with slaves on a chain sandy passed within ten yards of me on
a mule hunting for me i imagined but the thing which clean
broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old
barrack in a square while we were enduring the spectacle of a man
being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies it was
the sight of a newsboy and i couldnt get at him still i had
one comfort here was proof that clarence was still alive and
banging away i meant to be with him before long the thought was
full of cheer 

i had one little glimpse of another thing one day which gave me
a great uplift it was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop 
telegraph or telephone sure i did very much wish i had a little
piece of it it was just what i needed in order to carry out my
project of escape my idea was to get loose some night along with
the king then gag and bind our master change clothes with him 
batter him into the aspect of a stranger hitch him to the slave chain 
assume possession of the property march to camelot and 

but you get my idea you see what a stunning dramatic surprise
i would wind up with at the palace it was all feasible if
i could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which i could
shape into a lock pick i could then undo the lumbering padlocks
with which our chains were fastened whenever i might choose 
but i never had any luck no such thing ever happened to fall
in my way however my chance came at last a gentleman who
had come twice before to dicker for me without result or indeed
any approach to a result came again i was far from expecting
ever to belong to him for the price asked for me from the time
i was first enslaved was exorbitant and always provoked either
anger or derision yet my master stuck stubbornly to it twenty two
dollars he wouldnt bate a cent the king was greatly admired 
because of his grand physique but his kingly style was against
him and he wasnt salable nobody wanted that kind of a slave 
i considered myself safe from parting from him because of my
extravagant price no i was not expecting to ever belong to
this gentleman whom i have spoken of but he had something which
i expected would belong to me eventually if he would but visit
us often enough it was a steel thing with a long pin to it with
which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in
front there were three of them he had disappointed me twice 
because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project
entirely safe but this time i succeeded i captured the lower
clasp of the three and when he missed it he thought he had lost
it on the way 

i had a chance to be glad about a minute then straightway a chance
to be sad again for when the purchase was about to fail as usual 
the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus
 in modern english 

 ill tell you what ill do im tired supporting these two for
no good give me twenty two dollars for this one and ill throw
the other one in 

the king couldnt get his breath he was in such a fury he began
to choke and gag and meantime the master and the gentleman moved
away discussing 

 an ye will keep the offer open 

 tis open till the morrow at this hour 

 then i will answer you at that time said the gentleman and
disappeared the master following him 

i had a time of it to cool the king down but i managed it 
i whispered in his ear to this effect 

 your grace will go for nothing but after another fashion and
so shall i to night we shall both be free 

 ah how is that 

 with this thing which i have stolen i will unlock these locks
and cast off these chains to night when he comes about nine thirty
to inspect us for the night we will seize him gag him batter
him and early in the morning we will march out of this town 
proprietors of this caravan of slaves 

that was as far as i went but the king was charmed and satisfied 
that evening we waited patiently for our fellow slaves to get
to sleep and signify it by the usual sign for you must not take
many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it it is
best to keep your own secrets no doubt they fidgeted only about
as usual but it didnt seem so to me it seemed to me that they
were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring 
as the time dragged on i got nervously afraid we shouldnt have
enough of it left for our needs so i made several premature
attempts and merely delayed things by it for i couldnt seem
to touch a padlock there in the dark without starting a rattle
out of it which interrupted somebodys sleep and made him turn
over and wake some more of the gang 

but finally i did get my last iron off and was a free man once
more i took a good breath of relief and reached for the kings
irons too late in comes the master with a light in one hand
and his heavy walking staff in the other i snuggled close among
the wallow of snorers to conceal as nearly as possible that i was
naked of irons and i kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring
for my man the moment he should bend over me 

but he didnt approach he stopped gazed absently toward our
dusky mass a minute evidently thinking about something else 
then set down his light moved musingly toward the door and before
a body could imagine what he was going to do he was out of the
door and had closed it behind him 

 quick said the king fetch him back 

of course it was the thing to do and i was up and out in a
moment but dear me there were no lamps in those days and
it was a dark night but i glimpsed a dim figure a few steps
away i darted for it threw myself upon it and then there was
a state of things and lively we fought and scuffled and struggled 
and drew a crowd in no time they took an immense interest in
the fight and encouraged us all they could and in fact couldnt
have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own
fight then a tremendous row broke out behind us and as much
as half of our audience left us with a rush to invest some
sympathy in that lanterns began to swing in all directions 
it was the watch gathering from far and near presently a halberd
fell across my back as a reminder and i knew what it meant 
i was in custody so was my adversary we were marched off toward
prison one on each side of the watchman here was disaster 
here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction i tried to
imagine what would happen when the master should discover that
it was i who had been fighting him and what would happen if they
jailed us together in the general apartment for brawlers and petty
law breakers as was the custom and what might 

just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction 
the freckled light from the watchmans tin lantern fell on it 
and by george he was the wrong man 



chapter xxxvii

an awful predicament

sleep it was impossible it would naturally have been impossible
in that noisome cavern of a jail with its mangy crowd of drunken 
quarrelsome and song singing rapscallions but the thing that
made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of was my
racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole
size of what might have happened yonder in the slave quarters
in consequence of that intolerable miscarriage of mine 

it was a long night but the morning got around at last i made
a full and frank explanation to the court i said i was a slave 
the property of the great earl grip who had arrived just after
dark at the tabard inn in the village on the other side of the
water and had stopped there over night by compulsion he being
taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder i had been
ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best
physician i was doing my best naturally i was running with all
my might the night was dark i ran against this common person
here who seized me by the throat and began to pummel me although
i told him my errand and implored him for the sake of the great
earl my masters mortal peril 

the common person interrupted and said it was a lie and was going
to explain how i rushed upon him and attacked him without a word 

 silence sirrah from the court take him hence and give him
a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of
a nobleman after a different fashion another time go 

then the court begged my pardon and hoped i would not fail
to tell his lordship it was in no wise the courts fault that this
high handed thing had happened i said i would make it all right 
and so took my leave took it just in time too he was starting
to ask me why i didnt fetch out these facts the moment i was
arrested i said i would if i had thought of it which was true
 but that i was so battered by that man that all my wit was knocked
out of me and so forth and so on and got myself away still
mumbling i didnt wait for breakfast no grass grew under my
feet i was soon at the slave quarters empty everybody gone 
that is everybody except one body the slave masters it lay
there all battered to pulp and all about were the evidences of
a terrific fight there was a rude board coffin on a cart at
the door and workmen assisted by the police were thinning a
road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in 

i picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk
with one so shabby as i and got his account of the matter 

 there were sixteen slaves here they rose against their master
in the night and thou seest how it ended 

 yes how did it begin 

 there was no witness but the slaves they said the slave that
was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange
way by magic arts twas thought by reason that he had no key 
and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured when
the master discovered his loss he was mad with despair and threw
himself upon his people with his heavy stick who resisted and
brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts
that brought him swiftly to his end 

 this is dreadful it will go hard with the slaves no doubt 
upon the trial 

 marry the trial is over 

 over 

 would they be a week think you and the matter so simple they
were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it 

 why i dont see how they could determine which were the guilty
ones in so short a time 

 which ones indeed they considered not particulars like to that 
they condemned them in a body wit ye not the law which men
say the romans left behind them here when they went that if one
slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it 

 true i had forgotten and when will these die 

 belike within a four and twenty hours albeit some say they will
wait a pair of days more if peradventure they may find the missing
one meantime 

the missing one it made me feel uncomfortable 

 is it likely they will find him 

 before the day is spent yes they seek him everywhere they
stand at the gates of the town with certain of the slaves who
will discover him to them if he cometh and none can pass out
but he will be first examined 

 might one see the place where the rest are confined 

 the outside of it yes the inside of it but ye will not want
to see that 

i took the address of that prison for future reference and then
sauntered off at the first second hand clothing shop i came to 
up a back street i got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman
who might be going on a cold voyage and bound up my face with
a liberal bandage saying i had a toothache this concealed my
worst bruises it was a transformation i no longer resembled my
former self then i struck out for that wire found it and
followed it to its den it was a little room over a butchers
shop which meant that business wasnt very brisk in the telegraphic
line the young chap in charge was drowsing at his table i locked
the door and put the vast key in my bosom this alarmed the young
fellow and he was going to make a noise but i said 

 save your wind if you open your mouth you are dead sure tackle
your instrument lively now call camelot 

 this doth amaze me how should such as you know aught of such
matters as 

 call camelot i am a desperate man call camelot or get away
from the instrument and i will do it myself 

 what you 

 yes certainly stop gabbling call the palace 

he made the call 

 now then call clarence 

 clarence who 

 never mind clarence who say you want clarence youll get
an answer 

he did so we waited five nerve straining minutes ten minutes
 how long it did seem and then came a click that was as familiar
to me as a human voice for clarence had been my own pupil 

 now my lad vacate they would have known my touch maybe 
and so your call was surest but im all right now 

he vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen but it didnt
win i used a cipher i didnt waste any time in sociabilities
with clarence but squared away for business straight off thus 

 the king is here and in danger we were captured and brought
here as slaves we should not be able to prove our identity
 and the fact is i am not in a position to try send a telegram
for the palace here which will carry conviction with it 

his answer came straight back 

 they dont know anything about the telegraph they havent had
any experience yet the line to london is so new better not
venture that they might hang you think up something else 

might hang us little he knew how closely he was crowding the
facts i couldnt think up anything for the moment then an idea
struck me and i started it along 

 send five hundred picked knights with launcelot in the lead and
send them on the jump let them enter by the southwest gate and
look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm 

the answer was prompt 

 they shall start in half an hour 

 all right clarence now tell this lad here that im a friend
of yours and a dead head and that he must be discreet and say
nothing about this visit of mine 

the instrument began to talk to the youth and i hurried away 
i fell to ciphering in half an hour it would be nine oclock 
knights and horses in heavy armor couldnt travel very fast 
these would make the best time they could and now that the ground
was in good condition and no snow or mud they would probably
make a seven mile gait they would have to change horses a couple
of times they would arrive about six or a little after it would
still be plenty light enough they would see the white cloth which
i should tie around my right arm and i would take command we
would surround that prison and have the king out in no time 
it would be showy and picturesque enough all things considered 
though i would have preferred noonday on account of the more
theatrical aspect the thing would have 

now then in order to increase the strings to my bow i thought
i would look up some of those people whom i had formerly recognized 
and make myself known that would help us out of our scrape 
without the knights but i must proceed cautiously for it was
a risky business i must get into sumptuous raiment and it
wouldnt do to run and jump into it no i must work up to it
by degrees buying suit after suit of clothes in shops wide apart 
and getting a little finer article with each change until i should
finally reach silk and velvet and be ready for my project so
i started 

but the scheme fell through like scat the first corner i turned 
i came plump upon one of our slaves snooping around with a watchman 
i coughed at the moment and he gave me a sudden look that bit right
into my marrow i judge he thought he had heard that cough before 
i turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter 
pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye those
people had stopped and were talking together and looking in at
the door i made up my mind to get out the back way if there
was a back way and i asked the shopwoman if i could step out
there and look for the escaped slave who was believed to be in
hiding back there somewhere and said i was an officer in disguise 
and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in
charge and would she be good enough to step there and tell him
he neednt wait but had better go at once to the further end of
the back alley and be ready to head him off when i rousted him out 

she was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated
murderers and she started on the errand at once i slipped out
the back way locked the door behind me put the key in my pocket
and started off chuckling to myself and comfortable 

well i had gone and spoiled it again made another mistake 
a double one in fact there were plenty of ways to get rid of
that officer by some simple and plausible device but no i must
pick out a picturesque one it is the crying defect of my character 
and then i had ordered my procedure upon what the officer being
human would naturally do whereas when you are least expecting it 
a man will now and then go and do the very thing which its not 
natural for him to do the natural thing for the officer to do 
in this case was to follow straight on my heels he would find
a stout oaken door securely locked between him and me before
he could break it down i should be far away and engaged in slipping
into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me
into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling
law dogs in britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity
of character but instead of doing the natural thing the officer
took me at my word and followed my instructions and so as i
came trotting out of that cul de sac full of satisfaction with my
own cleverness he turned the corner and i walked right into his
handcuffs if i had known it was a cul de sac however there
isnt any excusing a blunder like that let it go charge it up
to profit and loss 

of course i was indignant and swore i had just come ashore from
a long voyage and all that sort of thing just to see you know 
if it would deceive that slave but it didnt he knew me then
i reproached him for betraying me he was more surprised than
hurt he stretched his eyes wide and said 

 what wouldst have me let thee of all men escape and not hang
with us when thourt the very cause of our hanging go to 

 go to was their way of saying i should smile or i like that 
queer talkers those people 

well there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case 
and so i dropped the matter when you cant cure a disaster by
argument what is the use to argue it isnt my way so i only said 

 youre not going to be hanged none of us are 

both men laughed and the slave said 

 ye have not ranked as a fool before you might better keep
your reputation seeing the strain would not be for long 

 it will stand it i reckon before to morrow we shall be out
of prison and free to go where we will besides 

the witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb made
a rasping noise in his throat and said 

 out of prison yes ye say true and free likewise to go where
ye will so ye wander not out of his grace the devils sultry realm 

i kept my temper and said indifferently 

 now i suppose you really think we are going to hang within
a day or two 

 i thought it not many minutes ago for so the thing was decided
and proclaimed 

 ah then youve changed your mind is that it 

 even that i only thought then i know now 

i felt sarcastical so i said 

 oh sapient servant of the law condescend to tell us then 
what you know 

 that ye will all be hanged to day at mid afternoon oho that
shot hit home lean upon me 

the fact is i did need to lean upon somebody my knights couldnt
arrive in time they would be as much as three hours too late 
nothing in the world could save the king of england nor me which
was more important more important not merely to me but to
the nation the only nation on earth standing ready to blossom
into civilization i was sick i said no more there wasnt
anything to say i knew what the man meant that if the missing
slave was found the postponement would be revoked the execution
take place to day well the missing slave was found 



chapter xxxviii

sir launcelot and knights to the rescue

nearing four in the afternoon the scene was just outside the
walls of london a cool comfortable superb day with a brilliant
sun the kind of day to make one want to live not die the
multitude was prodigious and far reaching and yet we fifteen
poor devils hadnt a friend in it there was something painful
in that thought look at it how you might there we sat on our
tall scaffold the butt of the hate and mockery of all those
enemies we were being made a holiday spectacle they had built
a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry and these were
there in full force with their ladies we recognized a good
many of them 

the crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of
the king the moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up 
in his fantastic rags with face bruised out of all recognition and
proclaimed himself arthur king of britain and denounced the
awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair
of his sacred head were touched it startled and surprised him
to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter it wounded his
dignity and he locked himself up in silence then although
the crowd begged him to go on and tried to provoke him to it
by catcalls jeers and shouts of 

 let him speak the king the king his humble subjects hunger
and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master
his serene and sacred raggedness 

but it went for nothing he put on all his majesty and sat under
this rain of contempt and insult unmoved he certainly was great
in his way absently i had taken off my white bandage and wound
it about my right arm when the crowd noticed this they began
upon me they said 

 doubtless this sailor man is his minister observe his costly
badge of office 

i let them go on until they got tired and then i said 

 yes i am his minister the boss and to morrow you will hear
that from camelot which 

i got no further they drowned me out with joyous derision but
presently there was silence for the sheriffs of london in their
official robes with their subordinates began to make a stir which
indicated that business was about to begin in the hush which
followed our crime was recited the death warrant read then
everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer 

then a slave was blindfolded the hangman unslung his rope there
lay the smooth road below us we upon one side of it the banked
multitude wailing its other side a good clear road and kept free
by the police how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen
come tearing down it but no it was out of the possibilities 
i followed its receding thread out into the distance not a horseman
on it or sign of one 

there was a jerk and the slave hung dangling dangling and hideously
squirming for his limbs were not tied 

a second rope was unslung in a moment another slave was dangling 

in a minute a third slave was struggling in the air it was
dreadful i turned away my head a moment and when i turned back
i missed the king they were blindfolding him i was paralyzed 
i couldnt move i was choking my tongue was petrified they
finished blindfolding him they led him under the rope i couldnt
shake off that clinging impotence but when i saw them put the
noose around his neck then everything let go in me and i made
a spring to the rescue and as i made it i shot one more glance
abroad by george here they came a tilting five hundred mailed
and belted knights on bicycles 

the grandest sight that ever was seen lord how the plumes
streamed how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession
of webby wheels 

i waved my right arm as launcelot swept in he recognized my rag
 i tore away noose and bandage and shouted 

 on your knees every rascal of you and salute the king who
fails shall sup in hell to night 

i always use that high style when im climaxing an effect well 
it was noble to see launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that
scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard and it was fine
to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg
their lives of the king they had just been deriding and insulting 
and as he stood apart there receiving this homage in rags 
i thought to myself well really there is something peculiarly
grand about the gait and bearing of a king after all 

i was immensely satisfied take the whole situation all around 
it was one of the gaudiest effects i ever instigated 

and presently up comes clarence his own self and winks and
says very modernly 

 good deal of a surprise wasnt it i knew youd like it ive
had the boys practicing this long time privately and just hungry
for a chance to show off 



chapter xxxix

the yankees fight with the knights

home again at camelot a morning or two later i found the paper 
damp from the press by my plate at the breakfast table i turned
to the advertising columns knowing i should find something of
personal interest to me there it was this

 trious kni ht sir sagramor le

 morning of the sixteenth day of this
 next succeeding month the battle
 will be a l outrance sith the said offence
 was of a deadly sort admitting of no
 composition 

 de par le roi


clarences editorial reference to this affair was to this effect

 n b this is the first tournament
 under the new law whidh allow each
 combatant to use any weapon he may pre 
 fer you may want to make a note of that 

up to the day set there was no talk in all britain of anything
but this combat all other topics sank into insignificance and
passed out of mens thoughts and interest it was not because
a tournament was a great matter it was not because sir sagramor
had found the holy grail for he had not but had failed it was
not because the second official personage in the kingdom was
one of the duellists no all these features were commonplace 
yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which
this coming fight was creating it was born of the fact that all
the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men 
so to speak but a duel between two mighty magicians a duel not
of muscle but of mind not of human skill but of superhuman art
and craft a final struggle for supremacy between the two master
enchanters of the age it was realized that the most prodigious
achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy
of comparison with a spectacle like this they could be but childs
play contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods 
yes all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel
between merlin and me a measuring of his magic powers against
mine it was known that merlin had been busy whole days and nights
together imbuing sir sagramors arms and armor with supernal
powers of offense and defense and that he had procured for him
from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the
wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other
men against sir sagramor so weaponed and protected a thousand
knights could accomplish nothing against him no known enchantments
could prevail these facts were sure regarding them there was
no doubt no reason for doubt there was but one question might
there be still other enchantments unknown to merlin which could
render sir sagramors veil transparent to me and make his enchanted
mail vulnerable to my weapons this was the one thing to be
decided in the lists until then the world must remain in suspense 

so the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here and
the world was right but it was not the one they had in their
minds no a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die 
 the life of knight errantry i was a champion it was true but
not the champion of the frivolous black arts i was the champion
of hard unsentimental common sense and reason i was entering
the lists to either destroy knight errantry or be its victim 

vast as the show grounds were there were no vacant spaces in them
outside of the lists at ten oclock on the morning of the th 
the mammoth grand stand was clothed in flags streamers and rich
tapestries and packed with several acres of small fry tributary
kings their suites and the british aristocracy with our own
royal gang in the chief place and each and every individual
a flashing prism of gaudy silks and velvets well i never saw
anything to begin with it but a fight between an upper mississippi
sunset and the aurora borealis the huge camp of beflagged and
gay colored tents at one end of the lists with a stiff standing
sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for
challenge was another fine sight you see every knight was
there who had any ambition or any caste feeling for my feeling
toward their order was not much of a secret and so here was their
chance if i won my fight with sir sagramor others would have
the right to call me out as long as i might be willing to respond 

down at our end there were but two tents one for me and another
for my servants at the appointed hour the king made a sign and
the heralds in their tabards appeared and made proclamation 
naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel there
was a pause then a ringing bugle blast which was the signal for
us to come forth all the multitude caught their breath and
an eager curiosity flashed into every face 

out from his tent rode great sir sagramor an imposing tower
of iron stately and rigid his huge spear standing upright in its
socket and grasped in his strong hand his grand horses face and
breast cased in steel his body clothed in rich trappings that
almost dragged the ground oh a most noble picture a great
shout went up of welcome and admiration 

and then out i came but i didnt get any shout there was
a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment then a great wave
of laughter began to sweep along that human sea but a warning
bugle blast cut its career short i was in the simplest and
comfortablest of gymnast costumes flesh colored tights from neck
to heel with blue silk puffings about my loins and bareheaded 
my horse was not above medium size but he was alert slender limbed 
muscled with watchsprings and just a greyhound to go he was
a beauty glossy as silk and naked as he was when he was born 
except for bridle and ranger saddle 

the iron tower and the gorgeous bedquilt came cumbrously but
gracefully pirouetting down the lists and we tripped lightly up
to meet them we halted the tower saluted i responded then
we wheeled and rode side by side to the grand stand and faced
our king and queen to whom we made obeisance the queen exclaimed 

 alack sir boss wilt fight naked and without lance or sword or 

but the king checked her and made her understand with a polite
phrase or two that this was none of her business the bugles
rang again and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists 
and took position now old merlin stepped into view and cast
a dainty web of gossamer threads over sir sagramor which turned
him into hamlets ghost the king made a sign the bugles blew 
sir sagramor laid his great lance in rest and the next moment here
he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind 
and i went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him
 cocking my ear the while as if noting the invisible knights
position and progress by hearing not sight a chorus of encouraging
shouts burst out for him and one brave voice flung out a heartening
word for me said 

 go it slim jim 

it was an even bet that clarence had procured that favor for me
 and furnished the language too when that formidable lance point
was within a yard and a half of my breast i twitched my horse aside
without an effort and the big knight swept by scoring a blank 
i got plenty of applause that time we turned braced up and
down we came again another blank for the knight a roar of
applause for me this same thing was repeated once more and
it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that sir sagramor lost his
temper and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task
of chasing me down why he hadnt any show in the world at that 
it was a game of tag with all the advantage on my side i whirled
out of his path with ease whenever i chose and once i slapped him
on the back as i went to the rear finally i took the chase into
my own hands and after that turn or twist or do what he would 
he was never able to get behind me again he found himself always
in front at the end of his maneuver so he gave up that business
and retired to his end of the lists his temper was clear gone now 
and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed
of mine i slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle and
grasped the coil in my right hand this time you should have seen
him come it was a business trip sure by his gait there was
blood in his eye i was sitting my horse at ease and swinging
the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head the
moment he was under way i started for him when the space between
us had narrowed to forty feet i sent the snaky spirals of the rope
a cleaving through the air then darted aside and faced about and
brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under
him for a surge the next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked
sir sagramor out of the saddle great scott but there was
a sensation 

unquestionably the popular thing in this world is novelty these
people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before 
and it carried them clear off their feet with delight from all
around and everywhere the shout went up 

 encore encore 

i wondered where they got the word but there was no time to cipher
on philological matters because the whole knight errantry hive
was just humming now and my prospect for trade couldnt have
been better the moment my lasso was released and sir sagramor
had been assisted to his tent i hauled in the slack took my
station and began to swing my loop around my head again i was
sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor
for sir sagramor and that couldnt take long where there were
so many hungry candidates indeed they elected one straight off
 sir hervis de revel 

 bzz here he came like a house afire i dodged he passed like
a flash with my horse hair coils settling around his neck 
a second or so later fst his saddle was empty 

i got another encore and another and another and still another 
when i had snaked five men out things began to look serious to
the ironclads and they stopped and consulted together as a
result they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send
their greatest and best against me to the astonishment of that
little world i lassoed sir lamorak de galis and after him
sir galahad so you see there was simply nothing to be done now 
but play their right bower bring out the superbest of the superb 
the mightiest of the mighty the great sir launcelot himself 

a proud moment for me i should think so yonder was arthur 
king of britain yonder was guenever yes and whole tribes of
little provincial kings and kinglets and in the tented camp yonder 
renowned knights from many lands and likewise the selectest body
known to chivalry the knights of the table round the most
illustrious in christendom and biggest fact of all the very sun
of their shining system was yonder couching his lance the focal
point of forty thousand adoring eyes and all by myself here was
i laying for him across my mind flitted the dear image of a
certain hello girl of west hartford and i wished she could see
me now in that moment down came the invincible with the rush
of a whirlwind the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward
 the fateful coils went circling through the air and before you
could wink i was towing sir launcelot across the field on his
back and kissing my hand to the storm of waving kerchiefs and
the thunder crash of applause that greeted me 

said i to myself as i coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddle horn 
and sat there drunk with glory the victory is perfect no other
will venture against me knight errantry is dead now imagine my
astonishment and everybody elses too to hear the peculiar
bugle call which announces that another competitor is about to
enter the lists there was a mystery here i couldnt account for
this thing next i noticed merlin gliding away from me and then
i noticed that my lasso was gone the old sleight of hand expert
had stolen it sure and slipped it under his robe 

the bugle blew again i looked and down came sagramor riding
again with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely re arranged 
i trotted up to meet him and pretended to find him by the sound
of his horses hoofs he said 

 thourt quick of ear but it will not save thee from this and
he touched the hilt of his great sword an ye are not able to see
it because of the influence of the veil know that it is no cumbrous
lance but a sword and i ween ye will not be able to avoid it 

his visor was up there was death in his smile i should never
be able to dodge his sword that was plain somebody was going
to die this time if he got the drop on me i could name the
corpse we rode forward together and saluted the royalties 
this time the king was disturbed he said 

 where is thy strange weapon 

 it is stolen sire 

 hast another at hand 

 no sire i brought only the one 

then merlin mixed in 

 he brought but the one because there was but the one to bring 
there exists none other but that one it belongeth to the king
of the demons of the sea this man is a pretender and ignorant 
else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts
only and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea 

 then is he weaponless said the king sir sagramore ye will
grant him leave to borrow 

 and i will lend said sir launcelot limping up he is as
brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live and he shall
have mine 

he put his hand on his sword to draw it but sir sagramor said 

 stay it may not be he shall fight with his own weapons it
was his privilege to choose them and bring them if he has erred 
on his head be it 

 knight said the king thourt overwrought with passion it
disorders thy mind wouldst kill a naked man 

 an he do it he shall answer it to me said sir launcelot 

 i will answer it to any he that desireth retorted sir sagramor hotly 

merlin broke in rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest
smile of malicious gratification 

 tis well said right well said and tis enough of parleying 
let my lord the king deliver the battle signal 

the king had to yield the bugle made proclamation and we turned
apart and rode to our stations there we stood a hundred yards
apart facing each other rigid and motionless like horsed statues 
and so we remained in a soundless hush as much as a full minute 
everybody gazing nobody stirring it seemed as if the king could
not take heart to give the signal but at last he lifted his hand 
the clear note of the bugle followed sir sagramors long blade
described a flashing curve in the air and it was superb to see him
come i sat still on he came i did not move people got so
excited that they shouted to me 

 fly fly save thyself this is murther 

i never budged so much as an inch till that thundering apparition
had got within fifteen paces of me then i snatched a dragoon
revolver out of my holster there was a flash and a roar and
the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell
what had happened 

here was a riderless horse plunging by and yonder lay sir sagramor 
stone dead 

the people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life
was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible 
no hurt upon his body nothing like a wound there was a hole
through the breast of his chain mail but they attached no importance
to a little thing like that and as a bullet wound there produces
but little blood none came in sight because of the clothing and
swaddlings under the armor the body was dragged over to let
the king and the swells look down upon it they were stupefied
with astonishment naturally i was requested to come and explain
the miracle but i remained in my tracks like a statue and said 

 if it is a command i will come but my lord the king knows that
i am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any desire
to come against me 

i waited nobody challenged then i said 

 if there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won 
i do not wait for them to challenge me i challenge them 

 it is a gallant offer said the king and well beseems you 
whom will you name first 

 i name none i challenge all here i stand and dare the chivalry
of england to come against me not by individuals but in mass 

 what shouted a score of knights 

 you have heard the challenge take it or i proclaim you recreant
knights and vanquished every one 

it was a bluff you know at such a time it is sound judgment
to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what
it is worth forty nine times out of fifty nobody dares to call 
and you rake in the chips but just this once well things looked
squally in just no time five hundred knights were scrambling
into their saddles and before you could wink a widely scattering
drove were under way and clattering down upon me i snatched
both revolvers from the holsters and began to measure distances
and calculate chances 

bang one saddle empty bang another one bang bang and
i bagged two well it was nip and tuck with us and i knew it 
if i spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people 
the twelfth man would kill me sure and so i never did feel
so happy as i did when my ninth downed its man and i detected
the wavering in the crowd which is premonitory of panic an instant
lost now could knock out my last chance but i didnt lose it 
i raised both revolvers and pointed them the halted host stood
their ground just about one good square moment then broke and fled 

the day was mine knight errantry was a doomed institution the
march of civilization was begun how did i feel ah you never
could imagine it 

and brer merlin his stock was flat again somehow every time
the magic of fol de rol tried conclusions with the magic of science 
the magic of fol de rol got left 



chapter xl

three years later

when i broke the back of knight errantry that time i no longer
felt obliged to work in secret so the very next day i exposed
my hidden schools my mines and my vast system of clandestine
factories and workshops to an astonished world that is to say 
i exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth 

well it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly 
the knights were temporarily down but if i would keep them so
i must just simply paralyze them nothing short of that would
answer you see i was bluffing that last time in the field 
it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion 
if i gave them a chance so i must not give them time and i didnt 

i renewed my challenge engraved it on brass posted it up where
any priest could read it to them and also kept it standing in
the advertising columns of the paper 

i not only renewed it but added to its proportions i said 
name the day and i would take fifty assistants and stand up
 against the massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it 

i was not bluffing this time i meant what i said i could do
what i promised there wasnt any way to misunderstand the language
of that challenge even the dullest of the chivalry perceived
that this was a plain case of put up or shut up they were
wise and did the latter in all the next three years they gave
me no trouble worth mentioning 

consider the three years sped now look around on england a happy
and prosperous country and strangely altered schools everywhere 
and several colleges a number of pretty good newspapers even
authorship was taking a start sir dinadan the humorist was first
in the field with a volume of gray headed jokes which i had been
familiar with during thirteen centuries if he had left out that
old rancid one about the lecturer i wouldnt have said anything 
but i couldnt stand that one i suppressed the book and hanged
the author 

slavery was dead and gone all men were equal before the law 
taxation had been equalized the telegraph the telephone the
phonograph the typewriter the sewing machine and all the thousand
willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working
their way into favor we had a steamboat or two on the thames 
we had steam warships and the beginnings of a steam commercial
marine i was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover
america 

we were building several lines of railway and our line from
camelot to london was already finished and in operation i was
shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger
service places of high and distinguished honor my idea was
to attract the chivalry and nobility and make them useful and keep
them out of mischief the plan worked very well the competition
for the places was hot the conductor of the express was
a duke there wasnt a passenger conductor on the line below
the degree of earl they were good men every one but they had
two defects which i couldnt cure and so had to wink at they
wouldnt lay aside their armor and they would knock down fare
 i mean rob the company 

there was hardly a knight in all the land who wasnt in some useful
employment they were going from end to end of the country in all
manner of useful missionary capacities their penchant for wandering 
and their experience in it made them altogether the most effective
spreaders of civilization we had they went clothed in steel and
equipped with sword and lance and battle axe and if they couldnt
persuade a person to try a sewing machine on the installment plan 
or a melodeon or a barbed wire fence or a prohibition journal 
or any of the other thousand and one things they canvassed for 
they removed him and passed on 

i was very happy things were working steadily toward a secretly
longed for point you see i had two schemes in my head which
were the vastest of all my projects the one was to overthrow the
catholic church and set up the protestant faith on its ruins
 not as an established church but a go as you please one and
the other project was to get a decree issued by and by commanding
that upon arthurs death unlimited suffrage should be introduced 
and given to men and women alike at any rate to all men wise
or unwise and to all mothers who at middle age should be found
to know nearly as much as their sons at twenty one arthur was
good for thirty years yet he being about my own age that is
to say forty and i believed that in that time i could easily
have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager
for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history
of the world a rounded and complete governmental revolution
without bloodshed the result to be a republic well i may
as well confess though i do feel ashamed when i think of it 
i was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president
myself yes there was more or less human nature in me i found
that out 

clarence was with me as concerned the revolution but in a modified
way his idea was a republic without privileged orders but with
a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective
chief magistrate he believed that no nation that had ever known
the joy of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it
and not fade away and die of melancholy i urged that kings were
dangerous he said then have cats he was sure that a royal
family of cats would answer every purpose they would be as useful
as any other royal family they would know as much they would
have the same virtues and the same treacheries the same disposition
to get up shindies with other royal cats they would be laughably
vain and absurd and never know it they would be wholly inexpensive 
finally they would have as sound a divine right as any other
royal house and tom vii or tom xi or tom xiv by the grace
of god king would sound as well as it would when applied to
the ordinary royal tomcat with tights on and as a rule said
he in his neat modern english the character of these cats would
be considerably above the character of the average king and this
would be an immense moral advantage to the nation for the reason
that a nation always models its morals after its monarchs the
worship of royalty being founded in unreason these graceful and
harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties 
and indeed more so because it would presently be noticed that
they hanged nobody beheaded nobody imprisoned nobody inflicted
no cruelties or injustices of any sort and so must be worthy of
a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king and
would certainly get it the eyes of the whole harried world would
soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system and royal butchers
would presently begin to disappear their subjects would fill
the vacancies with catlings from our own royal house we should
become a factory we should supply the thrones of the world within
forty years all europe would be governed by cats and we should
furnish the cats the reign of universal peace would begin then 
to end no more forever me e e yow ow ow ow fzt wow 

hang him i supposed he was in earnest and was beginning to be
persuaded by him until he exploded that cat howl and startled me
almost out of my clothes but he never could be in earnest he
didnt know what it was he had pictured a distinct and perfectly
rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy 
but he was too feather headed to know it or care anything about
it either i was going to give him a scolding but sandy came
flying in at that moment wild with terror and so choked with sobs
that for a minute she could not get her voice i ran and took her
in my arms and lavished caresses upon her and said beseechingly 

 speak darling speak what is it 

her head fell limp upon my bosom and she gasped almost inaudibly 

 hello central 

 quick i shouted to clarence telephone the kings homeopath
to come 

in two minutes i was kneeling by the childs crib and sandy was
dispatching servants here there and everywhere all over the
palace i took in the situation almost at a glance membranous
croup i bent down and whispered 

 wake up sweetheart hello central 

she opened her soft eyes languidly and made out to say 

 papa 

that was a comfort she was far from dead yet i sent for
preparations of sulphur i rousted out the croup kettle myself 
for i dont sit down and wait for doctors when sandy or the child
is sick i knew how to nurse both of them and had had experience 
this little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life 
and often i could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh
through the tear dews on its eye lashes when even its mother couldnt 

sir launcelot in his richest armor came striding along the great
hall now on his way to the stock board he was president of the
stock board and occupied the siege perilous which he had bought
of sir galahad for the stock board consisted of the knights of
the round table and they used the round table for business purposes
now seats at it were worth well you would never believe the
figure so it is no use to state it sir launcelot was a bear and
he had put up a corner in one of the new lines and was just getting
ready to squeeze the shorts to day but what of that he was
the same old launcelot and when he glanced in as he was passing
the door and found out that his pet was sick that was enough
for him bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all
him he would come right in here and stand by little hello central
for all he was worth and that was what he did he shied his
helmet into the corner and in half a minute he had a new wick
in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup kettle by this
time sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib and everything
was ready 

sir launcelot got up steam he and i loaded up the kettle with
unslaked lime and carbolic acid with a touch of lactic acid added
thereto then filled the thing up with water and inserted the
steam spout under the canopy everything was ship shape now 
and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch 
sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple
of church wardens with willow bark and sumach tobacco for us 
and told us to smoke as much as we pleased it couldnt get under
the canopy and she was used to smoke being the first lady in the
land who had ever seen a cloud blown well there couldnt be
a more contented or comfortable sight than sir launcelot in his
noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard
of snowy church warden he was a beautiful man a lovely man 
and was just intended to make a wife and children happy but of
course guenever however its no use to cry over whats done and
cant be helped 

well he stood watch and watch with me right straight through 
for three days and nights till the child was out of danger then
he took her up in his great arms and kissed her with his plumes
falling about her golden head then laid her softly in sandys
lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall between
the ranks of admiring men at arms and menials and so disappeared 
and no instinct warned me that i should never look upon him again
in this world lord what a world of heart break it is 

the doctors said we must take the child away if we would coax
her back to health and strength again and she must have sea air 
so we took a man of war and a suite of two hundred and sixty
persons and went cruising about and after a fortnight of this we
stepped ashore on the french coast and the doctors thought it
would be a good idea to make something of a stay there the little
king of that region offered us his hospitalities and we were glad
to accept if he had had as many conveniences as he lacked we
should have been plenty comfortable enough even as it was we
made out very well in his queer old castle by the help of comforts
and luxuries from the ship 

at the end of a month i sent the vessel home for fresh supplies 
and for news we expected her back in three or four days she
would bring me along with other news the result of a certain
experiment which i had been starting it was a project of mine
to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an
escape for the extra steam of the chivalry keep those bucks
entertained and out of mischief and at the same time preserve
the best thing in them which was their hardy spirit of emulation 
i had had a choice band of them in private training for some time 
and the date was now arriving for their first public effort 

this experiment was baseball in order to give the thing vogue
from the start and place it out of the reach of criticism i chose
my nines by rank not capacity there wasnt a knight in either
team who wasnt a sceptered sovereign as for material of this
sort there was a glut of it always around arthur you couldnt
throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king of course 
i couldnt get these people to leave off their armor they wouldnt
do that when they bathed they consented to differentiate the
armor so that a body could tell one team from the other but that
was the most they would do so one of the teams wore chain mail
ulsters and the other wore plate armor made of my new bessemer
steel their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing i
ever saw being ball proof they never skipped out of the way 
but stood still and took the result when a bessemer was at the bat
and a ball hit him it would bound a hundred and fifty yards
sometimes and when a man was running and threw himself on his
stomach to slide to his base it was like an iron clad coming into
port at first i appointed men of no rank to act as umpires but
i had to discontinue that these people were no easier to please
than other nines the umpires first decision was usually his
last they broke him in two with a bat and his friends toted him
home on a shutter when it was noticed that no umpire ever survived
a game umpiring got to be unpopular so i was obliged to appoint
somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would
protect him 

here are the names of the nines 

 bessemers ulsters

 king arthur emperor lucius 
 king lot of lothian king logris 
 king of northgalis king marhalt of ireland 
 king marsil king morganore 
 king of little britain king mark of cornwall 
 king labor king nentres of garlot 
 king pellam of listengese king meliodas of liones 
 king bagdemagus king of the lake 
 king tolleme la feintes the sowdan of syria 

 umpire clarence 

the first public game would certainly draw fifty thousand people 
and for solid fun would be worth going around the world to see 
everything would be favorable it was balmy and beautiful spring
weather now and nature was all tailored out in her new clothes 



chapter xli

the interdict

however my attention was suddenly snatched from such matters 
our child began to lose ground again and we had to go to sitting
up with her her case became so serious we couldnt bear to allow
anybody to help in this service so we two stood watch and watch 
day in and day out ah sandy what a right heart she had how
simple and genuine and good she was she was a flawless wife
and mother and yet i had married her for no other particular
reasons except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property
until some knight should win her from me in the field she had
hunted britain over for me had found me at the hanging bout
outside of london and had straightway resumed her old place at
my side in the placidest way and as of right i was a new englander 
and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her 
sooner or later she couldnt see how but i cut argument short
and we had a wedding 

now i didnt know i was drawing a prize yet that was what i did
draw within the twelvemonth i became her worshiper and ours
was the dearest and perfectest comradeship that ever was people
talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same
sex what is the best of that sort as compared with the friendship
of man and wife where the best impulses and highest ideals of
both are the same there is no place for comparison between
the two friendships the one is earthly the other divine 

in my dreams along at first i still wandered thirteen centuries
away and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up
and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world many a
time sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep 
with a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our
child conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine 
it touched me to tears and it also nearly knocked me off my feet 
too when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward and played
her quaint and pretty surprise upon me 

 the name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved here made
holy and the music of it will abide alway in our ears now
thoult kiss me as knowing the name i have given the child 

but i didnt know it all the same i hadnt an idea in the
world but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her
pretty game so i never let on but said 

 yes i know sweetheart how dear and good it is of you too 
but i want to hear these lips of yours which are also mine utter
it first then its music will be perfect 

pleased to the marrow she murmured 

 hello central 

i didnt laugh i am always thankful for that but the strain
ruptured every cartilage in me and for weeks afterward i could
hear my bones clack when i walked she never found out her mistake 
the first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone
she was surprised and not pleased but i told her i had given
order for it that henceforth and forever the telephone must
always be invoked with that reverent formality in perpetual honor
and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake this
was not true but it answered 

well during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib and in
our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of
that sick room then our reward came the center of the universe
turned the corner and began to mend grateful it isnt the term 
there isnt any term for it you know that yourself if youve
watched your child through the valley of the shadow and seen it
come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one
all illuminating smile that you could cover with your hand 

why we were back in this world in one instant then we looked
the same startled thought into each others eyes at the same
moment more than two weeks gone and that ship not back yet 

in another minute i appeared in the presence of my train they
had been steeped in troubled bodings all this time their faces
showed it i called an escort and we galloped five miles to a
hilltop overlooking the sea where was my great commerce that
so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful
with its white winged flocks vanished every one not a sail 
from verge to verge not a smoke bank just a dead and empty
solitude in place of all that brisk and breezy life 

i went swiftly back saying not a word to anybody i told sandy
this ghastly news we could imagine no explanation that would
begin to explain had there been an invasion an earthquake 
a pestilence had the nation been swept out of existence but
guessing was profitless i must go at once i borrowed the kings
navy a ship no bigger than a steam launch and was soon ready 

the parting ah yes that was hard as i was devouring the child
with last kisses it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary 
 the first time in more than two weeks and it made fools of us
for joy the darling mispronunciations of childhood dear me 
theres no music that can touch it and how one grieves when it
wastes away and dissolves into correctness knowing it will never
visit his bereaved ear again well how good it was to be able
to carry that gracious memory away with me 

i approached england the next morning with the wide highway of
salt water all to myself there were ships in the harbor at
dover but they were naked as to sails and there was no sign
of life about them it was sunday yet at canterbury the streets
were empty strangest of all there was not even a priest in sight 
and no stroke of a bell fell upon my ear the mournfulness of
death was everywhere i couldnt understand it at last in
the further edge of that town i saw a small funeral procession
 just a family and a few friends following a coffin no priest 
a funeral without bell book or candle there was a church there
close at hand but they passed it by weeping and did not enter it 
i glanced up at the belfry and there hung the bell shrouded in
black and its tongue tied back now i knew now i understood
the stupendous calamity that had overtaken england invasion 
invasion is a triviality to it it was the interdict 

i asked no questions i didnt need to ask any the church had
struck the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise and
go warily one of my servants gave me a suit of clothes and
when we were safe beyond the town i put them on and from that time
i traveled alone i could not risk the embarrassment of company 

a miserable journey a desolate silence everywhere even in
london itself traffic had ceased men did not talk or laugh or
go in groups or even in couples they moved aimlessly about each
man by himself with his head down and woe and terror at his heart 
the tower showed recent war scars verily much had been happening 

of course i meant to take the train for camelot train why 
the station was as vacant as a cavern i moved on the journey
to camelot was a repetition of what i had already seen the monday
and the tuesday differed in no way from the sunday i arrived
far in the night from being the best electric lighted town in
the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever
saw it was become simply a blot a blot upon darkness that is
to say it was darker and solider than the rest of the darkness 
and so you could see it a little better it made me feel as if
maybe it was symbolical a sort of sign that the church was going to
 keep the upper hand now and snuff out all my beautiful civilization
just like that i found no life stirring in the somber streets 
i groped my way with a heavy heart the vast castle loomed black
upon the hilltop not a spark visible about it the drawbridge
was down the great gate stood wide i entered without challenge 
my own heels making the only sound i heard and it was sepulchral
enough in those huge vacant courts 



chapter xlii

war 

i found clarence alone in his quarters drowned in melancholy 
and in place of the electric light he had reinstituted the ancient
rag lamp and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains
drawn tight he sprang up and rushed for me eagerly saying 

 oh its worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again 

he knew me as easily as if i hadnt been disguised at all which
frightened me one may easily believe that 

 quick now tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster i said 
 how did it come about 

 well if there hadnt been any queen guenever it wouldnt have
come so early but it would have come anyway it would have
come on your own account by and by by luck it happened to come
on the queens 

 and sir launcelots 

 just so 

 give me the details 

 i reckon you will grant that during some years there has been
only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking
steadily askance at the queen and sir launcelot 

 yes king arthurs 

 and only one heart that was without suspicion 

 yes the kings a heart that isnt capable of thinking evil
of a friend 

 well the king might have gone on still happy and unsuspecting 
to the end of his days but for one of your modern improvements
 the stock board when you left three miles of the london 
canterbury and dover were ready for the rails and also ready and
ripe for manipulation in the stock market it was wildcat and
everybody knew it the stock was for sale at a give away what
does sir launcelot do but 

 yes i know he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song 
then he bought about twice as much more deliverable upon call 
and he was about to call when i left 

 very well he did call the boys couldnt deliver oh he had
them and he just settled his grip and squeezed them they were
laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock
to him at and and along there that wasnt worth well 
when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths 
they rested up that side by shifting the laugh to the other side 
that was when they compromised with the invincible at 

 good land 

 he skinned them alive and they deserved it anyway the whole
kingdom rejoiced well among the flayed were sir agravaine and
sir mordred nephews to the king end of the first act act
second scene first an apartment in carlisle castle where the
court had gone for a few days hunting persons present the
whole tribe of the kings nephews mordred and agravaine propose
to call the guileless arthurs attention to guenever and sir
launcelot sir gawaine sir gareth and sir gaheris will have
nothing to do with it a dispute ensues with loud talk in the
midst of it enter the king mordred and agravaine spring their
devastating tale upon him tableau a trap is laid for launcelot 
by the kings command and sir launcelot walks into it he made
it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses to wit 
mordred agravaine and twelve knights of lesser rank for he
killed every one of them but mordred but of course that couldnt
straighten matters between launcelot and the king and didnt 

 oh dear only one thing could result i see that war and
the knights of the realm divided into a kings party and a
sir launcelots party 

 yes that was the way of it the king sent the queen to the
stake proposing to purify her with fire launcelot and his
knights rescued her and in doing it slew certain good old friends
of yours and mine in fact some of the best we ever had to wit 
sir belias le orgulous sir segwarides sir griflet le fils de dieu 
sir brandiles sir aglovale 

 oh you tear out my heartstrings 

 wait im not done yet sir tor sir gauter sir gillimer 

 the very best man in my subordinate nine what a handy right fielder
he was 

 sir reynolds three brothers sir damus sir priamus sir kay
the stranger 

 my peerless short stop ive seen him catch a daisy cutter in
his teeth come i cant stand this 

 sir driant sir lambegus sir herminde sir pertilope 
sir perimones and whom do you think 

 rush go on 

 sir gaheris and sir gareth both 

 oh incredible their love for launcelot was indestructible 

 well it was an accident they were simply onlookers they were
unarmed and were merely there to witness the queens punishment 
sir launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury 
and he killed these without noticing who they were here is an
instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle its
for sale on every news stand there the figures nearest the queen
are sir launcelot with his sword up and sir gareth gasping his
latest breath you can catch the agony in the queens face through
the curling smoke its a rattling battle picture 

 indeed it is we must take good care of it its historical value
is incalculable go on 

 well the rest of the tale is just war pure and simple launcelot
retreated to his town and castle of joyous gard and gathered
there a great following of knights the king with a great host 
went there and there was desperate fighting during several days 
and as a result all the plain around was paved with corpses
and cast iron then the church patched up a peace between arthur
and launcelot and the queen and everybody everybody but sir gawaine 
he was bitter about the slaying of his brothers gareth and gaheris 
and would not be appeased he notified launcelot to get him
thence and make swift preparation and look to be soon attacked 
so launcelot sailed to his duchy of guienne with his following and
gawaine soon followed with an army and he beguiled arthur to go
with him arthur left the kingdom in sir mordreds hands until
you should return 

 ah a kings customary wisdom 

 yes sir mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship
permanent he was going to marry guenever as a first move but
she fled and shut herself up in the tower of london mordred
attacked the bishop of canterbury dropped down on him with the
interdict the king returned mordred fought him at dover at
canterbury and again at barham down then there was talk of peace
and a composition terms mordred to have cornwall and kent during
arthurs life and the whole kingdom afterward 

 well upon my word my dream of a republic to be a dream and
so remain 

 yes the two armies lay near salisbury gawaine gawaines head
is at dover castle he fell in the fight there gawaine appeared to
arthur in a dream at least his ghost did and warned him to
refrain from conflict for a month let the delay cost what it might 
but battle was precipitated by an accident arthur had given
order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over
the proposed treaty with mordred sound the trumpet and fall on 
for he had no confidence in mordred mordred had given a similar
order to his people well by and by an adder bit a knights heel 
the knight forgot all about the order and made a slash at the
adder with his sword inside of half a minute those two prodigious
hosts came together with a crash they butchered away all day 
then the king however we have started something fresh since
you left our paper has 

 no what is that 

 war correspondence 

 why thats good 

 yes the paper was booming right along for the interdict made
no impression got no grip while the war lasted i had war
correspondents with both armies i will finish that battle by
reading you what one of the boys says 

 then the king looked about him and then was he
 ware of all his host and of all his good knights
 were left no more on live but two knights that
 was sir lucan de butlere and his brother sir
 bedivere and they were full sore wounded jesu
 mercy said the king where are all my noble
 knights becomen alas that ever i should see this
 doleful day for now said arthur i am come to
 mine end but would to god that i wist where were
 that traitor sir mordred that hath caused all
 this mischief then was king arthur ware where sir
 mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap
 of dead men now give me my spear said arthur
 unto sir lucan for yonder i have espied the
 traitor that all this woe hath wrought sir let
 him be said sir lucan for he is unhappy and if
 ye pass this unhappy day ye shall be right well
 revenged upon him good lord remember ye of your
 nights dream and what the spirit of sir gawaine
 told you this night yet god of his great goodness
 hath preserved you hitherto therefore for gods
 sake my lord leave off by this for blessed be
 god ye have won the field for here we be three
 on live and with sir mordred is none on live 
 and if ye leave off now this wicked day of
 destiny is past tide me death betide me life 
 saith the king now i see him yonder alone he
 shall never escape mine hands for at a better
 avail shall i never have him god speed you well 
 said sir bedivere then the king gat his spear
 in both his hands and ran toward sir mordred
 crying traitor now is thy death day come and
 when sir mordred heard sir arthur he ran until
 him with his sword drawn in his hand and then
 king arthur smote sir mordred under the shield 
 with a foin of his spear throughout the body more
 than a fathom and when sir mordred felt that he
 had his deaths wound he thrust himself with
 the might that he had up to the butt of king
 arthurs spear and right so he smote his father
 arthur with his sword holden in both his hands 
 on the side of the head that the sword pierced
 the helmet and the brain pan and therewithal
 sir mordred fell stark dead to the earth and
 the noble arthur fell in a swoon to the earth 
 and there he swooned oft times 

 that is a good piece of war correspondence clarence you are
a first rate newspaper man well is the king all right did
he get well 

 poor soul no he is dead 

i was utterly stunned it had not seemed to me that any wound
could be mortal to him 

 and the queen clarence 

 she is a nun in almesbury 

 what changes and in such a short while it is inconceivable 
what next i wonder 

 i can tell you what next 

 well 

 stake our lives and stand by them 

 what do you mean by that 

 the church is master now the interdict included you with mordred 
it is not to be removed while you remain alive the clans are
gathering the church has gathered all the knights that are left
alive and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business
on our hands 

 stuff with our deadly scientific war material with our hosts
of trained 

 save your breath we havent sixty faithful left 

 what are you saying our schools our colleges our vast
workshops our 

 when those knights come those establishments will empty themselves
and go over to the enemy did you think you had educated the
superstition out of those people 

 i certainly did think it 

 well then you may unthink it they stood every strain easily
 until the interdict since then they merely put on a bold
outside at heart they are quaking make up your mind to it
 when the armies come the mask will fall 

 its hard news we are lost they will turn our own science
against us 

 no they wont 

 why 

 because i and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game 
ill tell you what ive done and what moved me to it smart as
you are the church was smarter it was the church that sent
you cruising through her servants the doctors 

 clarence 

 it is the truth i know it every officer of your ship was
the churchs picked servant and so was every man of the crew 

 oh come 

 it is just as i tell you i did not find out these things at once 
but i found them out finally did you send me verbal information 
by the commander of the ship to the effect that upon his return
to you with supplies you were going to leave cadiz 

 cadiz i havent been at cadiz at all 

 going to leave cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely 
for the health of your family did you send me that word 

 of course not i would have written wouldnt i 

 naturally i was troubled and suspicious when the commander
sailed again i managed to ship a spy with him i have never
heard of vessel or spy since i gave myself two weeks to hear
from you in then i resolved to send a ship to cadiz there was
a reason why i didnt 

 what was that 

 our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared also as
suddenly and as mysteriously the railway and telegraph and
telephone service ceased the men all deserted poles were cut
down the church laid a ban upon the electric light i had to be
up and doing and straight off your life was safe nobody in
these kingdoms but merlin would venture to touch such a magician
as you without ten thousand men at his back i had nothing to
think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your
coming i felt safe myself nobody would be anxious to touch
a pet of yours so this is what i did from our various works
i selected all the men boys i mean whose faithfulness under
whatsoever pressure i could swear to and i called them together
secretly and gave them their instructions there are fifty two of
them none younger than fourteen and none above seventeen years old 

 why did you select boys 

 because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition
and reared in it it is in their blood and bones we imagined
we had educated it out of them they thought so too the interdict
woke them up like a thunderclap it revealed them to themselves 
and it revealed them to me too with boys it was different such
as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had
no acquaintance with the churchs terrors and it was among these
that i found my fifty two as a next move i paid a private visit
to that old cave of merlins not the small one the big one 

 yes the one where we secretly established our first great electric
plant when i was projecting a miracle 

 just so and as that miracle hadnt become necessary then 
i thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now ive
provisioned the cave for a siege 

 a good idea a first rate idea 

 i think so i placed four of my boys there as a guard inside 
and out of sight nobody was to be hurt while outside but any
attempt to enter well we said just let anybody try it then
i went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires
which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite
deposits under all our vast factories mills workshops magazines 
etc and about midnight i and my boys turned out and connected
that wire with the cave and nobody but you and i suspects where
the other end of it goes to we laid it under ground of course and
it was all finished in a couple of hours or so we shant have
to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization 

 it was the right move and the natural one military necessity 
in the changed condition of things well what changes have come 
we expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other but
 however go on 

 next we built a wire fence 

 wire fence 

 yes you dropped the hint of it yourself two or three years ago 

 oh i remember the time the church tried her strength against
us the first time and presently thought it wise to wait for a
hopefuler season well how have you arranged the fence 

 i start twelve immensely strong wires naked not insulated
 from a big dynamo in the cave dynamo with no brushes except
a positive and a negative one 

 yes thats right 

 the wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level
ground a hundred yards in diameter they make twelve independent
fences ten feet apart that is to say twelve circles within
circles and their ends come into the cave again 

 right go on 

 the fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart 
and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground 

 that is good and strong 

 yes the wires have no ground connection outside of the cave 
they go out from the positive brush of the dynamo there is a
ground connection through the negative brush the other ends of
the wire return to the cave and each is grounded independently 

 no no that wont do 

 why 

 its too expensive uses up force for nothing you dont want
any ground connection except the one through the negative brush 
the other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave
and fastened independently and without any ground connection 
now then observe the economy of it a cavalry charge hurls
itself against the fence you are using no power you are spending
no money for there is only one ground connection till those horses
come against the wire the moment they touch it they form a
connection with the negative brush through the ground and drop
dead dont you see you are using no energy until it is needed 
your lightning is there and ready like the load in a gun but
it isnt costing you a cent till you touch it off oh yes the
single ground connection 

 of course i dont know how i overlooked that its not only
cheaper but its more effectual than the other way for if wires
break or get tangled no harm is done 

 no especially if we have a tell tale in the cave and disconnect
the broken wire well go on the gatlings 

 yes thats arranged in the center of the inner circle on a
spacious platform six feet high ive grouped a battery of thirteen
gatling guns and provided plenty of ammunition 

 thats it they command every approach and when the churchs
knights arrive theres going to be music the brow of the
precipice over the cave 

 ive got a wire fence there and a gatling they wont drop any
rocks down on us 

 well and the glass cylinder dynamite torpedoes 

 thats attended to its the prettiest garden that was ever
planted its a belt forty feet wide and goes around the outer
fence distance between it and the fence one hundred yards kind of
neutral ground that space is there isnt a single square yard
of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo we laid them
on the surface of the ground and sprinkled a layer of sand over
them its an innocent looking garden but you let a man start
in to hoe it once and youll see 

 you tested the torpedoes 

 well i was going to but 

 but what why its an immense oversight not to apply a 

 test yes i know but theyre all right i laid a few in the
public road beyond our lines and theyve been tested 

 oh that alters the case who did it 

 a church committee 

 how kind 

 yes they came to command us to make submission you see they
didnt really come to test the torpedoes that was merely an incident 

 did the committee make a report 

 yes they made one you could have heard it a mile 

 unanimous 

 that was the nature of it after that i put up some signs for the
protection of future committees and we have had no intruders since 

 clarence youve done a world of work and done it perfectly 

 we had plenty of time for it there wasnt any occasion for hurry 

we sat silent awhile thinking then my mind was made up and
i said 

 yes everything is ready everything is shipshape no detail is
wanting i know what to do now 

 so do i sit down and wait 

 no sir rise up and strike 

 do you mean it 

 yes indeed the de fensive isnt in my line and the of fensive
is that is when i hold a fair hand two thirds as good a hand
as the enemy oh yes well rise up and strike thats our game 

 a hundred to one you are right when does the performance begin 

 now well proclaim the republic 

 well that will precipitate things sure enough 

 it will make them buzz i tell you england will be a hornets
nest before noon to morrow if the churchs hand hasnt lost its
cunning and we know it hasnt now you write and ill dictate thus 

 proclamation

 

 be it known unto all whereas the king having died
 and left no heir it becomes my duty to continue the
 executive authority vested in me until a government
 shall have been created and set in motion the
 monarchy has lapsed it no longer exists by
 consequence all political power has reverted to its
 original source the people of the nation with the
 monarchy its several adjuncts died also wherefore
 there is no longer a nobility no longer a privileged
 class no longer an established church all men are
 become exactly equal they are upon one common
 level and religion is free a republic is hereby
 proclaimed as being the natural estate of a nation
 when other authority has ceased it is the duty of
 the british people to meet together immediately 
 and by their votes elect representatives and deliver
 into their hands the government 

i signed it the boss and dated it from merlins cave 
clarence said 

 why that tells where we are and invites them to call right away 

 that is the idea we strike by the proclamation then its
their innings now have the thing set up and printed and posted 
right off that is give the order then if youve got a couple
of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill ho for merlins cave 

 i shall be ready in ten minutes what a cyclone there is going
to be to morrow when this piece of paper gets to work its a
pleasant old palace this is i wonder if we shall ever again
 but never mind about that 



chapter xliii

the battle of the sand belt

in merlins cave clarence and i and fifty two fresh bright 
well educated clean minded young british boys at dawn i sent
an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop
operations and remove all life to a safe distance as everything
was going to be blown up by secret mines and no telling at what
moment therefore vacate at once these people knew me and
had confidence in my word they would clear out without waiting
to part their hair and i could take my own time about dating the
explosion you couldnt hire one of them to go back during the
century if the explosion was still impending 

we had a week of waiting it was not dull for me because i was
writing all the time during the first three days i finished
turning my old diary into this narrative form it only required
a chapter or so to bring it down to date the rest of the week
i took up in writing letters to my wife it was always my habit
to write to sandy every day whenever we were separate and now
i kept up the habit for love of it and of her though i couldnt
do anything with the letters of course after i had written them 
but it put in the time you see and was almost like talking 
it was almost as if i was saying sandy if you and hello central
were here in the cave instead of only your photographs what
good times we could have and then you know i could imagine
the baby goo gooing something out in reply with its fists in its
mouth and itself stretched across its mothers lap on its back 
and she a laughing and admiring and worshipping and now and then
tickling under the babys chin to set it cackling and then maybe
throwing in a word of answer to me herself and so on and so on
 well dont you know i could sit there in the cave with my pen 
and keep it up that way by the hour with them why it was
almost like having us all together again 

i had spies out every night of course to get news every report
made things look more and more impressive the hosts were gathering 
gathering down all the roads and paths of england the knights were
riding and priests rode with them to hearten these original
crusaders this being the churchs war all the nobilities big
and little were on their way and all the gentry this was all
as was expected we should thin out this sort of folk to such
a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step
to the front with their republic and 

ah what a donkey i was toward the end of the week i began to get
this large and disenchanting fact through my head that the mass
of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for
about one day and there an end the church the nobles and
the gentry then turned one grand all disapproving frown upon them
and shriveled them into sheep from that moment the sheep had
begun to gather to the fold that is to say the camps and offer
their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the righteous
cause why even the very men who had lately been slaves were
in the righteous cause and glorifying it praying for it 
sentimentally slabbering over it just like all the other commoners 
imagine such human muck as this conceive of this folly 

yes it was now death to the republic everywhere not a dissenting
voice all england was marching against us truly this was more
than i had bargained for 

i watched my fifty two boys narrowly watched their faces their
walk their unconscious attitudes for all these are a language
 a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of
emergency when we have secrets which we want to keep i knew
that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again
in their minds and hearts all england is marching against us 
and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition 
ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations until
even in their sleep they would find no rest from it but hear
the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say all england 
 all england is marching against you i knew all this would
happen i knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great
that it would compel utterance therefore i must be ready with an
answer at that time an answer well chosen and tranquilizing 

i was right the time came they had to speak poor lads it
was pitiful to see they were so pale so worn so troubled at
first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words but he
presently got both this is what he said and he put it in the
neat modern english taught him in my schools 

 we have tried to forget what we are english boys we have tried
to put reason before sentiment duty before love our minds
approve but our hearts reproach us while apparently it was
only the nobility only the gentry only the twenty five or thirty
thousand knights left alive out of the late wars we were of one
mind and undisturbed by any troubling doubt each and every one
of these fifty two lads who stand here before you said they
have chosen it is their affair but think the matter is
altered all england is marching against us oh sir consider 
 reflect these people are our people they are bone of our bone 
flesh of our flesh we love them do not ask us to destroy our nation 

well it shows the value of looking ahead and being ready for
a thing when it happens if i hadnt foreseen this thing and been
fixed that boy would have had me i couldnt have said a word 
but i was fixed i said 

 my boys your hearts are in the right place you have thought the
worthy thought you have done the worthy thing you are english
boys you will remain english boys and you will keep that name
unsmirched give yourselves no further concern let your minds be
at peace consider this while all england is marching against
us who is in the van who by the commonest rules of war will
march in the front answer me 

 the mounted host of mailed knights 

 true they are thirty thousand strong acres deep they will march 
now observe none but they will ever strike the sand belt then
there will be an episode immediately after the civilian multitude
in the rear will retire to meet business engagements elsewhere 
none but nobles and gentry are knights and none but these will
remain to dance to our music after that episode it is absolutely
true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand
knights now speak and it shall be as you decide shall we
avoid the battle retire from the field 

 no 

the shout was unanimous and hearty 

 are you are you well afraid of these thirty thousand knights 

that joke brought out a good laugh the boys troubles vanished
away and they went gaily to their posts ah they were a darling
fifty two as pretty as girls too 

i was ready for the enemy now let the approaching big day come
along it would find us on deck 

the big day arrived on time at dawn the sentry on watch in the
corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under
the horizon and a faint sound which he thought to be military
music breakfast was just ready we sat down and ate it 

this over i made the boys a little speech and then sent out
a detail to man the battery with clarence in command of it 

the sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over
the land and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us 
with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea 
nearer and nearer it came and more and more sublimely imposing
became its aspect yes all england was there apparently soon
we could see the innumerable banners fluttering and then the sun
struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash yes it was a fine
sight i hadnt ever seen anything to beat it 

at last we could make out details all the front ranks no telling
how many acres deep were horsemen plumed knights in armor 
suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets the slow walk burst into
a gallop and then well it was wonderful to see down swept
that vast horse shoe wave it approached the sand belt my breath
stood still nearer nearer the strip of green turf beyond the
yellow belt grew narrow narrower still became a mere ribbon in
front of the horses then disappeared under their hoofs great
scott why the whole front of that host shot into the sky with
a thunder crash and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments 
and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was
left of the multitude from our sight 

time for the second step in the plan of campaign i touched
a button and shook the bones of england loose from her spine 

in that explosion all our noble civilization factories went up in
the air and disappeared from the earth it was a pity but it
was necessary we could not afford to let the enemy turn our own
weapons against us 

now ensued one of the dullest quarter hours i had ever endured 
we waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire 
and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these we couldnt
see over the wall of smoke and we couldnt see through it but
at last it began to shred away lazily and by the end of another
quarter hour the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled
to satisfy itself no living creature was in sight we now
perceived that additions had been made to our defenses the
dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide all around
us and cast up an embankment some twenty five feet high on both
borders of it as to destruction of life it was amazing moreover 
it was beyond estimate of course we could not count the dead 
because they did not exist as individuals but merely as homogeneous
protoplasm with alloys of iron and buttons 

no life was in sight but necessarily there must have been some
wounded in the rear ranks who were carried off the field under
cover of the wall of smoke there would be sickness among the
others there always is after an episode like that but there
would be no reinforcements this was the last stand of the chivalry
of england it was all that was left of the order after the recent
annihilating wars so i felt quite safe in believing that the
utmost force that could for the future be brought against us
would be but small that is of knights i therefore issued a
congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words 

 soldiers champions of human liberty and equality 
 your general congratulates you in the pride of his
 strength and the vanity of his renown an arrogant
 enemy came against you you were ready the conflict
 was brief on your side glorious this mighty
 victory having been achieved utterly without loss 
 stands without example in history so long as the
 planets shall continue to move in their orbits the
 battle of the sand belt will not perish out of the
 memories of men 

 the boss 

i read it well and the applause i got was very gratifying to me 
i then wound up with these remarks 

 the war with the english nation as a nation is at an end 
the nation has retired from the field and the war before it can
be persuaded to return war will have ceased this campaign is
the only one that is going to be fought it will be brief
 the briefest in history also the most destructive to life 
considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to
numbers engaged we are done with the nation henceforth we deal
only with the knights english knights can be killed but they
cannot be conquered we know what is before us while one of
these men remains alive our task is not finished the war is not
ended we will kill them all loud and long continued applause 

i picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by
the dynamite explosion merely a lookout of a couple of boys
to announce the enemy when he should appear again 

next i sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond
our lines on the south to turn a mountain brook that was there 
and bring it within our lines and under our command arranging
it in such a way that i could make instant use of it in an emergency 
the forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each and
were to relieve each other every two hours in ten hours the
work was accomplished 

it was nightfall now and i withdrew my pickets the one who
had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight but visible
with the glass only he also reported that a few knights had been
feeling their way toward us and had driven some cattle across our
lines but that the knights themselves had not come very near 
that was what i had been expecting they were feeling us you
see they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror
on them again they would grow bolder in the night perhaps 
i believed i knew what project they would attempt because it was
plainly the thing i would attempt myself if i were in their places
and as ignorant as they were i mentioned it to clarence 

 i think you are right said he it is the obvious thing for
them to try 

 well then i said if they do it they are doomed 

 certainly 

 they wont have the slightest show in the world 

 of course they wont 

 its dreadful clarence it seems an awful pity 

the thing disturbed me so that i couldnt get any peace of mind
for thinking of it and worrying over it so at last to quiet
my conscience i framed this message to the knights 

 to the honorable the commander of the insurgent
 chivalry of england you fight in vain we know
 your strength if one may call it by that name 
 we know that at the utmost you cannot bring
 against us above five and twenty thousand knights 
 therefore you have no chance none whatever 
 reflect we are well equipped well fortified we
 number fifty four what men no minds the
 capablest in the world a force against which
 mere animal might may no more hope to prevail than
 may the idle waves of the sea hope to prevail
 against the granite barriers of england be advised 
 we offer you your lives for the sake of your
 families do not reject the gift we offer you
 this chance and it is the last throw down your
 arms surrender unconditionally to the republic 
 and all will be forgiven 

 signed the boss 

i read it to clarence and said i proposed to send it by a flag
of truce he laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with and said 

 somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what
these nobilities are now let us save a little time and trouble 
consider me the commander of the knights yonder now then 
you are the flag of truce approach and deliver me your message 
and i will give you your answer 

i humored the idea i came forward under an imaginary guard of
the enemys soldiers produced my paper and read it through 
for answer clarence struck the paper out of my hand pursed up
a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain 

 dismember me this animal and return him in a basket to the
base born knave who sent him other answer have i none 

how empty is theory in presence of fact and this was just fact 
and nothing else it was the thing that would have happened 
there was no getting around that i tore up the paper and granted
my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest 

then to business i tested the electric signals from the gatling
platform to the cave and made sure that they were all right 
i tested and retested those which commanded the fences these
were signals whereby i could break and renew the electric current
in each fence independently of the others at will i placed the
brook connection under the guard and authority of three of my
best boys who would alternate in two hour watches all night and
promptly obey my signal if i should have occasion to give it
 three revolver shots in quick succession sentry duty was discarded
for the night and the corral left empty of life i ordered that
quiet be maintained in the cave and the electric lights turned
down to a glimmer 

as soon as it was good and dark i shut off the current from all
the fences and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering
our side of the great dynamite ditch i crept to the top of it
and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch but it was
too dark to see anything as for sounds there were none the
stillness was deathlike true there were the usual night sounds
of the country the whir of night birds the buzzing of insects 
the barking of distant dogs the mellow lowing of far off kine
 but these didnt seem to break the stillness they only intensified
it and added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain 

i presently gave up looking the night shut down so black but
i kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound for
i judged i had only to wait and i shouldnt be disappointed 
however i had to wait a long time at last i caught what you
may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound 
i pricked up my ears then and held my breath for this was the
sort of thing i had been waiting for this sound thickened and
approached from toward the north presently i heard it at my
own level the ridge top of the opposite embankment a hundred
feet or more away then i seemed to see a row of black dots appear
along that ridge human heads i couldnt tell it mightnt be
anything at all you cant depend on your eyes when your imagination
is out of focus however the question was soon settled i heard
that metallic noise descending into the great ditch it augmented
fast it spread all along and it unmistakably furnished me this
fact an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch yes 
these people were arranging a little surprise party for us we
could expect entertainment about dawn possibly earlier 

i groped my way back to the corral now i had seen enough i went
to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two
inner fences then i went into the cave and found everything
satisfactory there nobody awake but the working watch i woke
clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men 
and that i believed all the knights were coming for us in a body 
it was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect
the ditchs ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment
and make an assault and be followed immediately by the rest
of their army 

clarence said 

 they will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make
preliminary observations why not take the lightning off the
outer fences and give them a chance 

 ive already done it clarence did you ever know me to be
inhospitable 

 no you are a good heart i want to go and 

 be a reception committee i will go too 

we crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside
fences even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight
somewhat but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and
soon it was adjusted for present circumstances we had had to feel
our way before but we could make out to see the fence posts now 
we started a whispered conversation but suddenly clarence broke
off and said 

 what is that 

 what is what 

 that thing yonder 

 what thing where 

 there beyond you a little piece dark something a dull shape
of some kind against the second fence 

i gazed and he gazed i said 

 could it be a man clarence 

 no i think not if you notice it looks a lit why it is 
a man leaning on the fence 

 i certainly believe it is let us go and see 

we crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close 
and then looked up yes it was a man a dim great figure in armor 
standing erect with both hands on the upper wire and of course 
there was a smell of burning flesh poor fellow dead as a
door nail and never knew what hurt him he stood there like a
statue no motion about him except that his plumes swished about
a little in the night wind we rose up and looked in through
the bars of his visor but couldnt make out whether we knew him
or not features too dim and shadowed 

we heard muffled sounds approaching and we sank down to the ground
where we were we made out another knight vaguely he was coming
very stealthily and feeling his way he was near enough now for
us to see him put out a hand find an upper wire then bend and
step under it and over the lower one now he arrived at the
first knight and started slightly when he discovered him he
stood a moment no doubt wondering why the other one didnt move
on then he said in a low voice why dreamest thou here good
sir mar then he laid his hand on the corpses shoulder and just
uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead killed by a dead
man you see killed by a dead friend in fact there was something
awful about it 

these early birds came scattering along after each other about
one every five minutes in our vicinity during half an hour 
they brought no armor of offense but their swords as a rule 
they carried the sword ready in the hand and put it forward and
found the wires with it we would now and then see a blue spark
when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible
to us but we knew what had happened all the same poor fellow 
he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been electrocuted 
we had brief intervals of grim stillness interrupted with piteous
regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron clad and
this sort of thing was going on right along and was very creepy
there in the dark and lonesomeness 

we concluded to make a tour between the inner fences we elected
to walk upright for conveniences sake we argued that if discerned 
we should be taken for friends rather than enemies and in any case
we should be out of reach of swords and these gentry did not seem
to have any spears along well it was a curious trip everywhere
dead men were lying outside the second fence not plainly visible 
but still visible and we counted fifteen of those pathetic
statues dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire 

one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated our current
was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out 
pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound and next moment
we guessed what it was it was a surprise in force coming i whispered
clarence to go and wake the army and notify it to wait in silence
in the cave for further orders he was soon back and we stood
by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful
work upon that swarming host one could make out but little of
detail but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up
beyond the second fence that swelling bulk was dead men our
camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead a bulwark 
a breastwork of corpses you may say one terrible thing about
this thing was the absence of human voices there were no cheers 
no war cries being intent upon a surprise these men moved as
noiselessly as they could and always when the front rank was near
enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get
a shout ready of course they struck the fatal line and went down
without testifying 

i sent a current through the third fence now and almost immediately
through the fourth and fifth so quickly were the gaps filled up 
i believed the time was come now for my climax i believed that
that whole army was in our trap anyway it was high time to find
out so i touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame
on the top of our precipice 

land what a sight we were enclosed in three walls of dead men 
all the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living 
who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires 
the sudden glare paralyzed this host petrified them you may say 
with astonishment there was just one instant for me to utilize
their immobility in and i didnt lose the chance you see in
another instant they would have recovered their faculties then
theyd have burst into a cheer and made a rush and my wires
would have gone down before it but that lost instant lost them
their opportunity forever while even that slight fragment of time
was still unspent i shot the current through all the fences and
struck the whole host dead in their tracks there was a groan
you could hear it voiced the death pang of eleven thousand men 
it swelled out on the night with awful pathos 

a glance showed that the rest of the enemy perhaps ten thousand
strong were between us and the encircling ditch and pressing
forward to the assault consequently we had them all and had
them past help time for the last act of the tragedy i fired
the three appointed revolver shots which meant 

 turn on the water 

there was a sudden rush and roar and in a minute the mountain
brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a
hundred feet wide and twenty five deep 

 stand to your guns men open fire 

the thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten
thousand they halted they stood their ground a moment against
that withering deluge of fire then they broke faced about and
swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale a full fourth
part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment 
the three fourths reached it and plunged over to death by drowning 

within ten short minutes after we had opened fire armed resistance
was totally annihilated the campaign was ended we fifty four were
masters of england twenty five thousand men lay dead around us 

but how treacherous is fortune in a little while say an hour
 happened a thing by my own fault which but i have no heart
to write that let the record end here 



chapter xliv

a postscript by clarence

i clarence must write it for him he proposed that we two
go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded i was
strenuous against the project i said that if there were many 
we could do but little for them and it would not be wise for us to
trust ourselves among them anyway but he could seldom be turned
from a purpose once formed so we shut off the electric current
from the fences took an escort along climbed over the enclosing
ramparts of dead knights and moved out upon the field the first
wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back
against a dead comrade when the boss bent over him and spoke
to him the man recognized him and stabbed him that knight was
sir meliagraunce as i found out by tearing off his helmet he
will not ask for help any more 

we carried the boss to the cave and gave his wound which was
not very serious the best care we could in this service we had
the help of merlin though we did not know it he was disguised
as a woman and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife 
in this disguise with brown stained face and smooth shaven he
had appeared a few days after the boss was hurt and offered to cook
for us saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps
which the enemy were forming and that she was starving the boss
had been getting along very well and had amused himself with
finishing up his record 

we were glad to have this woman for we were short handed we
were in a trap you see a trap of our own making if we stayed
where we were our dead would kill us if we moved out of our
defenses we should no longer be invincible we had conquered 
in turn we were conquered the boss recognized this we all
recognized it if we could go to one of those new camps and
patch up some kind of terms with the enemy yes but the boss
could not go and neither could i for i was among the first that
were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands 
others were taken down and still others to morrow 

 to morrow it is here and with it the end about midnight
i awoke and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about
the bosss head and face and wondered what it meant everybody
but the dynamo watch lay steeped in sleep there was no sound 
the woman ceased from her mysterious foolery and started tip toeing
toward the door i called out 

 stop what have you been doing 

she halted and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction 

 ye were conquerors ye are conquered these others are perishing
 you also ye shall all die in this place every one except him 
he sleepeth now and shall sleep thirteen centuries i am merlin 

then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled
about like a drunken man and presently fetched up against one
of our wires his mouth is spread open yet apparently he is still
laughing i suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until
the corpse turns to dust 

the boss has never stirred sleeps like a stone if he does not
wake to day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is and
his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses
of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it as for
the rest of us well it is agreed that if any one of us ever
escapes alive from this place he will write the fact here and
loyally hide this manuscript with the boss our dear good chief 
whose property it is be he alive or dead 



the end of the manuscript





final p s by m t 

the dawn was come when i laid the manuscript aside the rain
had almost ceased the world was gray and sad the exhausted storm
was sighing and sobbing itself to rest i went to the strangers
room and listened at his door which was slightly ajar i could
hear his voice and so i knocked there was no answer but i still
heard the voice i peeped in the man lay on his back in bed 
talking brokenly but with spirit and punctuating with his arms 
which he thrashed about restlessly as sick people do in delirium 
i slipped in softly and bent over him his mutterings and
ejaculations went on i spoke merely a word to call his attention 
his glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with
pleasure gratitude gladness welcome 

 oh sandy you are come at last how i have longed for you sit
by me do not leave me never leave me again sandy never again 
where is your hand give it me dear let me hold it there
 now all is well all is peace and i am happy again we are happy
again isnt it so sandy you are so dim so vague you are but
a mist a cloud but you are here and that is blessedness sufficient 
and i have your hand dont take it away it is for only a little
while i shall not require it long was that the child 
hello central she doesnt answer asleep perhaps bring her
when she wakes and let me touch her hands her face her hair 
and tell her good bye sandy yes you are there i lost
myself a moment and i thought you were gone have i been
sick long it must be so it seems months to me and such dreams 
such strange and awful dreams sandy dreams that were as real
as reality delirium of course but so real why i thought
the king was dead i thought you were in gaul and couldnt get
home i thought there was a revolution in the fantastic frenzy
of these dreams i thought that clarence and i and a handful of
my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of england 
but even that was not the strangest i seemed to be a creature
out of a remote unborn age centuries hence and even that was
as real as the rest yes i seemed to have flown back out of that
age into this of ours and then forward to it again and was set
down a stranger and forlorn in that strange england with an
abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you between
me and my home and my friends between me and all that is dear
to me all that could make life worth the living it was awful
 awfuler than you can ever imagine sandy ah watch by me sandy
 stay by me every moment dont let me go out of my mind again 
death is nothing let it come but not with those dreams not with
the torture of those hideous dreams i cannot endure that again 
sandy 

he lay muttering incoherently some little time then for a time he
lay silent and apparently sinking away toward death presently
his fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet and by that sign
i knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the
death rattle in his throat he started up slightly and seemed
to listen then he said 

 a bugle it is the king the drawbridge there man the
battlements turn out the 

he was getting up his last effect but he never finished it
